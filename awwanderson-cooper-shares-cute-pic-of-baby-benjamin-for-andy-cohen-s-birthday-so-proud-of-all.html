However, someone else made an appearance: Andy’s son. “HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! @bravoandy. So proud of all you’ve done, and for you and Baby Benjamin, it’s just the beginning!” the CNN personality wrote.</p><p><strong>Take a look at the full pic below!</strong></p><p>People couldn’t get enough of the precious photo either. “Love the Benjamin’s look … he’s Beautiful!!! He’s a lucky boy to have great men in his life!” a fan said. Another added, “I love this side eye! Benjamin is a whole mood!!”</p><p>The TV personality has been all about his son ever since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">welcoming him via surrogate</a> — he has shared a ton of photos of him on social media and seems to spend every minute with his cute baby. However, since his dad is well known, little Benjamin has also been able to meet famous folks like <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Ripa</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong></a>.</p><p>“Deeply in love,” the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Live With Kelly and Ryan</a> cohost, 48, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">captioned a photo</a> showing Benjamin in her arms. In fact, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All My Children</a>&nbsp;alum is so head over heels in love with Andy’s baby that it made her think about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">having another child</a> with husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Mark Consuelos</strong></a>.</p><p>“I was putting it out there for [Mark] last night,” Kelly told Andy, who was filling in for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong></a> during the April 15 episode on the NBC talk show.</p><p>She added that Mark, also 48, wasn’t exactly all about having baby number four. “He was like, ‘It’s all right. Let’s be grateful for what we have.'” Kelly jokingly said. “And then he put on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Game of Thrones</a> and fell asleep, which was the anti-aphrodisiac.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46apZ2doqi8r3nCqKapnaJiwKmt0Z6qZqiZmHqwsoybmJuxXZeyr7bApqCnZZakv26tzZ2wZpufnbKvv4yboKusmJmuuns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
