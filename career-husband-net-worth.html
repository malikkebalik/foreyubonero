The name of her parents is <strong>Whitney Blake</strong> and <strong>Tom Baxter</strong>. She also owns two brothers <strong>Richard</strong> and <strong>Brian</strong>. Baxter shares a pretty close relationship with her brothers and also the family.</p><p>Likewise, the talented actress belongs to American nationality and also holds the white ethnicity. Her zodiac sign falls under Cancer.</p><h2>Age and Body Measurements</h2><p>Meredith was born in 1947, which makes her 72 years old as of now. She stands at the height of 5’6″, but her weight is not known to the general media. Even though Ann is in her 70’s the beauty never seems to fade away. Sadly there is no information available about the vital body statistics.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Phyllis Logan Bio, Age, Height, Downtown Abbey, Husband, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>Baxter is blessed with a mesomorph build and has a pretty slim body figure. Along with her body measurements, the shining pair of blue eyes and not to forget flawless blonde hair is something that adds up to her beauty.</p><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><p>Meredith was born in California and spent most of her childhood there. But this American actress had a pretty hard childhood. In the year 1953, her parents separated, and she had a hard time passing on. Baxter grew up with her mother, with most of her needs being fulfilled with ease.</p><p>For the educational background, though, Ann attended James Monroe High School and graduated from the same institute. Later in the time being, Baxter moved to Hollywood High School and the time there resulted in visiting Interlochen Centre for Arts, ultimately returning to Hollywood High to graduate in 1965.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Meredith is a hard worker from early childhood, and from her learning days, this blonde tried her best in every department to do good; acting or voice artist. In the initial days, though, her appearances were seen in few shows like The Young Lawyers, The Partridge Family.</p><p>But the big break came in the year 1972 when Baxter was part of Bridgett Loves Bernie, and following this success came the big-screen debut in Stand Up and Be Counted. Likewise, in the year 1982, another big thing, the Family Ties, came through, which added to the acting skills. Beyond all of this, some other good works include the likes of Kate’s Secret.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arryn Zech Age, Height, Career, RWBY, Boyfriend, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>Not only in the movie and series, Meredith was seen in commercials like Garden State Life Insurance Company and also hosted NBC morning news and talk show. There were more successes and some setbacks in her career when in 2014 a big plus news came forward when Ann became the part of The Young and the Restless.</p><p>Therefore the success is more to be talked about on this artist. More and more movies and series have only added up to her charm, fame, and personality build-up. We can say with ease that she falls under the illustrious list of great actresses in Hollywood.</p><h2>Meredith Baxter Birney Husband</h2><p>Meredith is 72 years old and living a blissful life. In comparison, how successful her acting life is, there is some gap in her personal life, though. Not once or twice, but this Family Ties actress has married four times and shares five children altogether.</p><p>In 1966 this diva shared her vows with <strong>Robert Lewis Bush</strong> and had two children <strong>Theodore Justin</strong> and <strong>Eva Whitney, </strong>but the marriage ended up in 1971 due to misunderstanding. After the failure here, Ann moved on to <strong>David Birney</strong> and tied the knot in 1974. From this marriage, too, Baxter had three children <strong>Kathleen Jeanne, Mollie Elizabeth,</strong> and <strong>Peter David Edwin</strong>.</p><p>But sadly, things didn’t go well with David, which resulted in separation in the year 1989. <strong>Micheal Blodgett</strong> is another lucky guy who got a chance to hold her hand in the year 1995 but made ways in just five years. After all the marriage failures in time, a new angle to her love story came up, and she married <strong>Nancy Locke</strong> on December 8, 2013, in LA.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/meredith-1355.jpg><p>At first, it was pretty challenging to understand the marriage, but later everyone accepted the fact, and they seem to be happy with where their relationship stands at this point.</p><h2>Meredith Baxter Birney Net Worth</h2><p>Meredith Ann Baxter is one of the proper names in the field of acting who has to give long years for the industry.
