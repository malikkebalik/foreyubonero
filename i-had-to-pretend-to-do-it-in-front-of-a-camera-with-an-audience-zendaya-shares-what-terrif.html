Despite three months of training where she learned the basics of footwork, arm movement, and stance, Zendaya still felt embarrassed when it was time to put it to practice on camera.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>‚ÄúThe more I had to pretend to do tennis in front of a camera with an audience, the more terrified I felt,‚Äù she shared, jokingly adding that she wasn‚Äôt even using a real ball. We wonder whether that didn‚Äôt make it all the more difficult.</p><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=true>In the film, her character, Tashi Duncan, has to play the U.S. Open, which means the day those scenes were filmed, Zendaya was playing tennis for an audience. The whole thing turned out to be more of a challenge than she thought. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just doing the form and footwork and getting my swing right and doing it in front of a whole bunch of people as if it‚Äôs the U.S. Open, and I‚Äôm terrified,‚Äù she continued.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>New photo of Zendaya as Tashi Donaldson behind the scenes of "Challengers " <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/aes4FJn3DN</a></p>‚Äî Challengers News (@challengersnews) <a href=#>June 25, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=714 data-injectable=true>Tashi eventually suffers a career-ending injury and turns to coaching, at which point she signs up her husband Art, played by West Side Story‚Äòs Mike Faist, for a Challenger event. The film turns the heat meter all the way up when Art‚Äôs opponent turns out to be Patrick (The Crown‚Äòs Josh O‚ÄôConnor), his former best friend, and Tashi‚Äôs former lover. Love triangles and threesomes ensue.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>Zendaya credited co-stars Faist and O‚ÄôConnor with motivating her to work out in preparation for the role.

As for Zendaya, she will probably be relieved that the world won‚Äôt have to see her tennis skills so soon (though we‚Äôre sure she‚Äôs as great as always).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooGagkZl6tbuMqamerJWjsW7AzmabqGWZqXqquoyfqaimpGK8p3nAZpqapZWnrm7DyK2fZpmeYq62sMiepZydXa%2Byr7DAsphmq5iWv6a%2FjLCfmqxdqbKzvsifoJ6cXZ2ys3nWoaClnV2btq25yKeeZpuYlrmtsc2gnKurXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
