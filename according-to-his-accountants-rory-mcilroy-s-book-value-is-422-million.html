They may not have ever admitted it out loud, but they did, and who could blame them?

However, as his star rises and his play improves, his earnings on and off the course are likely to increase.</p><p>Back in 2013, he brought home $29.6 million with $13.6 million coming from his play on the golf course and the other $16 million from endorsements. He signed his deal with Nike in 2013. At first, it was rumored to be worth as much as $250 million, but it was eventually learned to be more in the $10-15 million range (depending on bonuses for wins and world ranking).</p><p>He's earned less from golf winnings the following year ($4.3 million), after changing clubs and struggling on the course at times, but his endorsement earnings rose to $20 million. In 2015 he got his golf game back under control and took home $16.3 million in golf winnings, and saw his endorsement earnings jump to $32 million.</p><p>At 26, there is no reason to think he is going to fall off the golf radar anytime soon. He's off to a decent start so far for the 2016 season. With two tournaments under his belt, he has already taken home over $150,000.</p><p>As his star continues to rise and Tiger's falls, his endorsement earnings are going to increase. Last year, Tiger won just&nbsp;$600,000 from golf, but took home $50 million from endorsements (down from $55 million in 2014 and $65 million in 2013).</p><p>As companies jump ship from Tiger, they are going to look for someone else's ship to jump onto. So while his projected book value is $422 million now, don't be surprised if the next projection is a lot higher.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjrKmrqScYrumwsSrZKCtlajAbrnUnJ9mqp%2Bnxm65wqKjq6epYrK5vMScq56cXay8s8DHZpuasV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
