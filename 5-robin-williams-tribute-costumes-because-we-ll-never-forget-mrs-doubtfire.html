The funnyman's passing remains a shock for many of his colleagues and his fans. While <a href=# class=T3D>Robin Williams' death</a> is still a fresh wound, fans, both male and female, can <a href=# class=T3D>pay tribute to the actor's roles</a>, his life, and his comedic legacy this Halloween by dressing in Robin Williams Halloween costumes. The fact that so many of his roles have become iconic and are woven into the fabric of pop culture is a testament to Williams' God-given gifts and talents as an entertainer who always, <i>always</i> made us laugh until our stomachs hurt or until we were grabbing our sides.</p><p>It turns out that several of Williams' most memorable characters — his titular Mrs. Doubtfire, the role which <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Williams was to reprise in the sequel</a>; Matt Damon's therapist in <i>Good Will Hunting;</i> the voice of the Genie in <i>Aladdin — </i>are easy to recreate this Halloween with a simple trip to the mall, to the local thrift shop, or to a Halloween specialty store. It's inexpensive and easy, but it can also be a lot of fun for both males and females. Sorta like Mrs. Doubtfire herself, right?</p><p>Williams' nuanced performance as Mrs. Doubtfire was a flawlessly executed, capturing both the emotions of a conflicted father and the parody of an elderly but sassafras nanny.</p><p>He was also faboosh and flamboyant in <i>The Birdcage. </i>Both roles are super fun to emulate in costume. Here are five ways to pay tribute to Robin Williams this Halloween in costume character form.</p><h3>1. Mrs. Doubtfire</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Wig</a>, $30, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a> </b>| <b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Skirt</a>, $28, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b> | <b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Cardigan</a>, $30, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b> | <b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Clogs</a>, $85, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b> | <b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Orthopedic Stockings</a>, $25, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b> |</p><p>Euphegenia Doubtfire had her own unique style. It was fugly, but it was DNA distinct. Hit your fave thrift spot and grab an <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>ankle-skimming skirt</a> and an oversized<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> cardi</a>. Pair ugly, orthopedic, and sensible <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>clogs</a> with <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>surgical-like stockings</a> that roll down below your knee and nab cheapie reading glasses that can be thrifted or purchased at a drugstore. Spend a little cash on the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>wig</a>. There, you're a cross-dressing nanny from the U.K. with an axe to grind with your ex-wife's suave new BF.</p><h3>2. Popeye</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Popeye Costume</a>, $30, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>Williams played the spinach-eating, pipe-smoking, anchor tattoo-having, and muscular sailor in 1980. The <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>costume is already assembled</a> and it's pretty universal. You can add your own touches, like a can of spinach. Find someone to dress up as Olive Oyl and go as a couple.</p><h3>3. Dr. Sean Maguire Of <i>Good Will Hunting</i></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Baggy Black Trousers</a>, $15, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b> | <b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Gray Blazer</a>, $13, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>Williams pretty much put Matt Damon and Ben Affleck on the A-list map. He starred as Dr. Sean Maguire in their <i>Good Will Hunting. </i>You don't need to raid grandpa's closet for this one. Thrift away, or go to Walmart, and come back with <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>baggy black trousers</a>, a bulky cardi, and a <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>gray blazer</a> and you, too, can look like a psychologist to a genius-slash-custodian.</p><h3>4. The Genie in <i>Aladdin</i></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Aladdin Genie Costume</a>, $38, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>This one is strictly for the ladies. The Genie in <i>Aladdin</i> is one of Williams' most beloved roles, but it was a voice role and the character is animated. There are lots of pretty <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>genie-like costumes</a> at Halloween-themed and party stores. This is a not-so-obvious way to pay homage to Williams, Robin.</p><h3>5. Armand Goldman, <i>The Birdcage</i></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Hawaiian Shirt,</a> $25, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b> | <b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Baseball Cap</a>, $7, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b> | <b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Gold Chains</a>, $8, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>Williams played flamboyant and hairy-chested South Beach drag club owner Armand Goldman in <i>The Birdcage</i> to much critical acclaim. He was over-the-top but his performance had depth. His fashion sense was campy and is another thrift job, where you can pick up a loud <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Hawaiian print shirt</a>, a white <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>baseball cap</a>, and more<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> gold chains</a> than Mr. T. Get an extreme 'stache at a costume shop and maybe do a makeshift yeti bag look with some faux chest hair. It shouldn't cost you more than $50.</p><p><i>Images: <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Giphy</a> (2); <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Polyvore</a> (5)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx1fpRwcGZtXae8o7XNZq6ipJyerq6%2FjK2popqlqbJur86sq66llah6o7HCmqysnV2ssq24jKecr52iYrOwvsaeq2aloqh6pbvUm6ufoaKa</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
