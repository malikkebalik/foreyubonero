After she got a taste of reality TV stardom, Pierzina left acting behind and featured as a cast member in other reality shows, such as The Amazing Race and Snake in the Grass.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>But her time on the small screen may be over, as Pierzina has turned her attention to real estate, a field which she seems to particularly enjoy. Still, there’s a chance that you may see this realtor on the small screen from time to time, as she sometimes makes appearances in shows like House Hunters. Between all the work, though, the star still has to make time for the family she built with her husband, Jess DeSanto.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>The two met when they attended University of Minnesota-Duluth together, and were friends for years before getting engaged in 2009. A year later, they tied the knot and started welcoming children into their lives. Currently, Pierzina resides in Edina, Minnesota, with her husband and their three kids, Violet, Lincoln, and Stella.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7HDZquoZZqWu6a4y55kqaGVp8equsBmnaunnWKvqrOMm6morJiav3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
