He called his choice “f***ing tough” and hoped Sarah understood that he made the move, unsure if he would get another chance to claim that amount of money.</p><p id=par-13_43>Additionally, he claimed the choice had nothing to do with revenge. Bananas felt cursed as he returned for six more seasons, unable to make the finals.
