Big Smo, also known as John Lee Smith, was born in San Diego, California, and grew up just outside of Shelbyville, Tennessee on his family farm in Unionville. His father was in the Navy for 25 years and then worked on an Air Force Base for another 27 years. He launched his rap career in 1999, and began performing and writing tracks. When&nbsp;he realized so many children were listening to his music, he started cleaning up his lyrics. He released his first album through Yayoda Records three years later.</p><p>He then self-produced two albums, releasing them in 2003 and 2004. He returned to Yayoda for a fourth release in 2007, and then produced another album on his own, called "American Made" in 2010. "American Made" became an unexpected breakout hit. He directed the music video to his track, "Kickin' It in Tennessee", and the video became hugely popular on YouTube, with over 5 million views. He subsequently signed with Warner Bros. Records, and has since released two EPs, and his first full-length studio album, "Kuntry Livin".&nbsp;In 2014, A&E began airing a reality television series about his life entitled, Big Smo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70qKloJ2iqHyjtcZmqqanXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
