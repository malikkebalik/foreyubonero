I can’t wait to play this album for you all because I am so pleased with how it turned out. On June 26th, Rodrigo announced her future album’s cover on Instagram.</p><p>The album cover features a prone singer dressed in a black tank top with a purple satin brἀ coming out the neckline; the background is a deep purple. Her rings spell out the word “guts” in the script.</p><h2>What was the motivation behind Olivia Rodrigo’s Second Studio Album?</h2><p>The Grammy victor stated that development is vital to Guts. In a press statement issued in June, Rodrigo said:</p><p>“For me, this album is about growing pains and trying to figure out who I am at this point in my life.”</p><p>It was such a dramatic moment of awkwardness and transition that I felt like I had aged 10 years between the ages of 18 and 20. I see that as a normal part of maturing, and I’d like to think that’s reflected in the record.</p><h2>When will Olivia Rodrigo’s New Song Vampire be Released?</h2><p><strong>On June 30th, a new song by Rodrigo titled “Vampire” will be made available.</strong> This will be her first single after the release of the music video for “Brutal” in August of 2021.</p><p>The California native posted an Instagram snapshot in May that appeared to hint at the lyrics, asking three times, “How do you lie?” She added a vampire emoji to the photo of the scribbled text.</p><h2>With Whom Did Olivia Rodrigo Collaborate on Guts?</h2><p>Producer Daniel Nigro, who had previously worked with the grads of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series on their album Sour, recorded Rodrigo’s vocals. <strong>Is Olivia Rodrigo happy with her second studio effort?</strong></p><p>Rodrigo said on her Instagram Story on June 26th, in the midst of unveiling Guts, that “making this album was very daunting, very fun, and very fulfilling.” I’m so excited for you to finally own it. Cheers to the bright future ahead!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Olivia-Rodrigo-Instagram-Story.webp alt="Olivia Rodrigo Instagram Story" width=1200 height=675 title="Vampire Olivia Rodrigo Release Date: When Will Her New Single Be Unleashed?" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>It’s not hard to guess why keeping up with Sour would be tough. Her first album went quadruple platinum and earned her three Grammys: Best New Artist, Best Pop Solo Performance, and Best Pop Vocal Album.</p><p>As the last track from Sour was being published, Rodrigo foretold her development. In August 2021, she shared with Clash that the upcoming album was “probably going to be a lot happier than the record I just made.”</p><p>“My tastes are always changing,” the ex-New Girl star said at the time, “and I think that will be reflected in the next album.”</p><p>After finishing her second album, Guts, Rodrigo said that the emo sound will still be present. The bulk of this CD was recorded when I was 19 years old. A year full of firsts, wrong turns, social blunders, and good ol’ fashioned adolescent angst, she reflected in a June newsletter to followers.</p><p><strong>Many famous celebrities have released their new album this month. You can read about their release date here:</strong></p><p>I’m really pleased with this video that my pal Dan and I created between New York and Los Angeles. I have no words to describe how thrilled I am to start this next chapter of my life with you. You have until September 8 to respond.</p><p>Olivia Rodrigo has become one of the most popular female singers because of her recent hits.
