He told some funny jokes that made me laugh but he came off as a smug jerk. You could tell they’d set it up ahead of time and Letterman was the straight man who helped Seinfeld move on to the next topic. Maybe I’m just unable to appreciate his humor after he responded to pretty compelling allegations that his wife plaigiarized another woman’s book by calling the other author names during his last appearance on the Late Show.</p><p>Seinfeld’s jokes were sort-of funny in that dry kind of way of his. I never got his sitcom when it was on and found it kind of useless and repetitive. They seemed to hardly vary the formula on that show, but I have friends who loved it and found it very funny.</p><p>Some of my favorite memories with my four year-old son are of kid’s parties. My son has his little friends he looks forward to seeing and he talks about them all the time. Seinfeld doesn’t agree. In his seated monologue on Seinfeld he called other people’s children funny-looking and mocked the concept of children that age having friends. It was just a joke, but it seems to be rooted in whatever reality is for the 54 year-old comic who owns every Porsche that’s ever been made:</p><p>“I go to [kids parties.] I hate every single one of them.</p><p>“Do you find that other people’s kids – they never look quite right? You ask your wife. Is his head supposed to be that way?</p><p>“I hate everything about kids birthday parties. They don’t know that these are their friends, they don’t know what’s going on.”</p><p>At least Seinfeld is going to these things with his kids and isn’t passing this kids off to a nanny or his wife to take them everywhere. Is he a curmudgeon dad who enjoys it despite himself or is he just going to these events to get material for these skits?</p><p>Seinfeld and his wife Jessica have three children, daughter Sascha, eight, and sons Julian Kal, five and a half, and Shepherd Kellen, three. Jerry and Jessica first met at a sports club in NY. Jessica was newly-married and working in public relations at the time. She quickly got a divorce and married Jerry in 1999.</p><p>Thanks to the <a href=#>Huffington Post</a> for featuring this video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma29ma4JwtsSrqbKXo5q2r7LEpZuYp6SdsrOrz56mqaSVqKystcOslqedppq%2FoLjOqKKYqaWewaar0aKeoaxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
