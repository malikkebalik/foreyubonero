Nascar now crowns a champion, sells its merchandise (like hotcakes!), and broadcasts its races on TV. The newest overhaul to Nascar is the "charter" system that takes 36 Sprint Cup teams and makes them franchises. This gives Nascar similarities to other sports leagues and makes revenue sharing easier. The new system comes with changes&nbsp;in the way&nbsp;drivers are paid. Under the old rules, drivers received a salary and a percentage of the race purse prize.</p><p>Under the new system, purse winnings will not be released weekly as they had been in the past. Also, charter teams are guaranteed a certain amount of money annually. This change isn't likely to make much of a difference to the sport's top drivers, however. Owners will rework the drivers' contracts to ensure their star doesn't lose any money under the new system.</p><p>As with&nbsp;most professional sports, there is a huge pay gap between the top and bottom drivers. Those in the back of the pack make in the mid-six-figure range each year, while the leaders up front make eight figures. There are&nbsp;13 Nascar drivers who made more than $10 million in 2015, these are the top 10.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-187661 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GettyImages-511244968.jpg alt="Matt Sullivan/Getty Images" width=900 height=606 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-187661 class=wp-caption-text>Matt Sullivan/Getty Images</p><li><a href=# title="Matt Kenseth Net Worth">Matt Kenseth</a></li><p>Total earnings: $11.9 million</p><p>Salary/winnings: $10.5 &nbsp;million</p><p>Endorsements/licensing: $1.4 million</p><p>Matt Kenseth had 18 wins over the last five years in Sprint Cup races.
