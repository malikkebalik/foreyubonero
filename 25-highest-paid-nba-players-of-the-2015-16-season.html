Chances are you probably thought you were one heck of a Marco Polo player back in the day. If you only could have gone pro as a Marco Polo player, right?</p><p>Most of the games we played as kids did not prepare us to make millions as adults, but there are some that did.

If you could count on him being healthy and playing like he can play maybe, but you can't.</p><p>As it stands, next year the top spot is going to belong to <a href=#>Anthony Davis</a> ($29 million). There are going to be some big name players due for new contracts after the 2015-16 season including LeBron James, <a href=#>Kevin Durant</a>, Kobe Bryant, <a href=# title="Joakim Noah Net Worth">Joakim Noah</a>, Joe Johnson, and many more.</p><p>Will they sign new long-term deals next season or wait till the following off-season when the new television contract kicks in and raises the maximum salary a player can get (depending on the number of years they have played) to $21 million, $25.3 million, and $29.5 million?</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-172114 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-461505116.jpg alt="Photo by Stephen Dunn/Getty Images" width=900 height=663 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-172114 class=wp-caption-text>Photo by Stephen Dunn/Getty Images</p><p>We will have to wait and see, but for the coming season these are the 25 highest paid players in the NBA:</p><p>20T.
