Set in the Hamptons, the series chronicled every move Emily made to destroy the people who led to the dismantling of her own family. Ending after four seasons, the series involved romance, lies, and action.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>New main character will get help from someone fans already know</h2><p id=par-3_30>Mike Kelley, series creator and executive producer of Revenge has teamed up with How to Get Away with Murder executive producer Joe Fazzio on the reboot, according to <a href=#>Deadline</a>.</p><p id=par-4_51>The new take on Revenger follows a Latinx character who is the daughter of a biochemist. With help from an original character, they will head to Malibu to exact revenge on the pharmaceutical empire responsible for the death of her mother and the end of her life as she knew it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who will be the returning cast member?&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-5_41>During a 2019 interview with <a href=#>TV Insider</a> about the Revenge reboot, VanCamp hinted at who among the original cast members might be returning. She didn’t call out an actor by name but she did say she’s excited about the casting choice.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_22>“I can’t say who, but they’re bringing back a specific person, and I love that specific person. So, it’s exciting,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-7_63>While casting has yet to be confirmed, some fans think Nolan Ross (Gabriel Mann) will return as the guide for the new main character. After all, Nolan helped Emily in her revenge plot against the Grayson family so why wouldn’t he come back to help another person do the same? And over the course of the show, Nolan became a fan favorite.</p><p id=par-8_28>Although he’s not the only original character who could return. Revenge had a large cast including Mann, Madeleine Stowe, Nick Wechsler, all of whom could reprise their roles.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Revenge’ may get a new storyline each season</h2><p id=par-9_56>Don’t get too attached to the characters in the new season of Revenge. Why? Because they may only be sticking around for one season only. When it returns, Revenge may focus on a character’s journey to get revenge only for a season before moving on to another character, Karey Burke, president of ABC Entertainment told Deadline.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_26>“The idea would be in that series would be to do a different revenge story each cycle. Revenge becomes the narrative like an anthology,” she said.</p><p id=par-11_17>Dirty John is set up the same way where a different character’s story is told each season.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_32>As for when the reboot of Revenge will air, those details have yet to be released.
