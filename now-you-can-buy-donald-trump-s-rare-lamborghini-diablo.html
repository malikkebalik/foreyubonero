Trump's 1997 Lamborghini Diablo VT Roadster has been officially put up for sale at an asking price of <strong>$299,000</strong>. It seems that once again Trump may have overvalued his brand, because most of these cars don't go for much more than $200 thousand.</p><p>Trump's Diablo is one of only 200 examples ever to be made. This Trump-mobile features a nice Le Mans Blue paint job with Trump 1997 badging that has been fittingly updated for his 2016 campaign.&nbsp; This Lambo features a 5.2 liter V12 engine with just under 500 horsepower and all-wheel drive. The Diablo VT Roadster was limited to just 200 cars which were made from 1995 to 1998. These models feature a revised front bumper as well as 17 inch wheels and an electrically operated carbon fiber targa top which is stored above the engine lid when it is not being used.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-235332 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-56074851.jpg alt width=900 height=588 sizes="(max-width: 1575px) 100vw, 1575px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-235332 class=wp-caption-text>David Hallett/Getty Images</p><p>It remains to be seen if this car will get the asking price of almost $300 thousand. Recently, an almost identical red Diablo VT Roadster with only 999 miles on it sold for $148,500 at Barrett Jackson. Does the fact that this car has been driven by Mr. Trump make it worth twice as much?</p><p>We all know that <a href=#>Donald Trump</a> makes and spends a whole lot of money. He owns a $100 million Boeing 757 and also has a quite impressive luxury car collection. Trump also owns a 2003 Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren valued at $455 thousand, a 1950s Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud, A Rolls-Royce Phantom which typically starts at half a million dollars, and the 2011 Chevrolet Camaro Indianapolis 500 Pace Car! His love for expensive vehicles does not stop there; Trump also owns a custom motorcycle made out of 24-karat gold and "elite custom parts" made by the team at Orange County Choppers.</p><p>At this point, anyone who owns something that has anything to do with Trump should be cashing in. Recently, Donald's 1991 Acura NSX showed up for sale on eBay. The car was purchased by Trump for his ex-wife <a href=#>Marla Maples</a>. After the couple divorced, Maples held onto the car before selling it to its current owner, who decided to cash in on the car's celebrity history. Enjoy Trump Mania while it lasts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm6vwKuqaKafrHqkrc1mma6xXZm8r63LnWStqqWivbR50ZqpnmWclrqju9Ggn6KmmWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
