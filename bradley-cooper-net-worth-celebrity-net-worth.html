Bradley can earn as much as $20 million for a movie, but also takes smaller upfront salaries in exchange for revenue participation. Between June 2018 and June 2019, Bradley earned $60 million, which made him one of the 5 highest-paid actors on the planet. His monster earnings during that period were due to the fact that he did not take a salary for his directorial debut "A Star Is Born" which went on to earn $434 million globally. He also earned backend points off "Avengers: Endgame" for his role as Rocket in the franchise.</p><h2 id=hangover-payday><strong>Hangover Payday</strong></h2><p>The four primary actors in "The Hangover" – Ed, Bradley, <a href=# title="Zach Galifianakis Net Worth">Zach Galifianakis</a> and <a href=# title="Justin Bartha Net Worth">Justin Bartha</a> – were relative unknowns before the movie was officially green-lit. The studio behind the project was so concerned about the lack of star power that it came very close to killing the movie altogether. Thankfully (for comedy fans), the movie's director Todd Phillips was so confident in his chosen actors that he went to the studio and offered to give back $6.5 million in salary in exchange for back-end points. He also reminded the studio that those four actors were set to earn less than $1 million, collectively.</p><p>The studio relented and the first Hangover went on to make $470 million at the box office and $75 million off DVD sales. It was the highest grossest R-rated comedy up to that point.</p><p>Amazingly, the studio never thought the lock in the four actors or Phillips for potential sequels. The group was therefore able to negotiate generous salaries and backend shares. When the sequel earned nearly $600 million at the box office, Todd Phillips earned another $70 million and the four actors each earned $30 million.</p><p>In total Phillips earned $150 million from the three Hangover movies and the four primary actors earned $40 million.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In December 2004, Cooper bought a three-bedroom, two-bathroom, 1,462 sq ft home in Venice, California for $1.199 million.
