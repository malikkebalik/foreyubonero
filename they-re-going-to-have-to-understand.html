Graziadei admitted that there’s just one thing he won’t give up.</p><p id=par-4_45>“I always say that the person I’m with is just going to have to understand,” he explained his bedroom behavior. “I don’t think I’m a night owl. I don’t think I’m an early bird, either. I think I’m somewhere in between on both of them.”</p><p id=par-5_25>He continued, “And I like my sleep. So if the person wants to be with me, it’s just something they’re going to have to understand.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-bachelor-star-s-love-life-is-under-a-stressful-microscope>‘The Bachelor’ star’s love life is under a stressful microscope</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/joey-graziadei-and-daisy-kent.jpg><p id=par-6_37>Joey Graziadei’s life is under a stressful microscope as the star of <a href=#>The Bachelor Season 28</a>. However, he finds that there are specific ways stress management can help with feeling overwhelmed both on the show and off-camera.</p><p id=par-7_31>He told GQ, “I feel the most comfortable just by being outside. So if I feel like there’s a lot of chaos or noise around me, I’ll go for a walk.”</p><p id=par-8_31>Graziadei will likely need to find a quiet space to collect his thoughts as he navigates learning about the remaining 22 women of his season. Ten were <a href=#>eliminated on night one</a>.</p><p id=par-9_56>He revealed that when stressed, he will “sit outside and take in some deep breaths and everything around me. I love to golf; I love to surf, as I said. These types of activities just let me clear my head. So de-stressing for me means taking the opportunity to step back and do something I love.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-will-one-woman-man-joey-graziadei-handle-dating-multiple-women>How will ‘one-woman-man’ Joey Graziadei handle dating multiple women?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_29>In an interview with<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> ABC7 NY</a>, Joey Graziadei reveals that, at heart, he is a one-woman man. Therefore, the thought of dating multiple women at one time remained stressful.</p><p id=par-11_34>“It’s a dream come true to have the opportunity to find that one woman. But it’s very difficult to go through this process when you feel unnatural through a lot of it,” he said.</p><p id=par-12_35>Graziadei admitted he’s a “one-woman man” who finds the thought of kissing so many <a href=#>contestants like Daisy Kent</a>, on night one, “weird.” However, he relies on his gut instinct when physically sealing a special moment.</p><p id=par-13_41>“It’s weird kissing this many women. I would never be in the situation anywhere else, but I just go off the moment and how it feels between the two of us, and that goes however it’s supposed to go,” he revealed.</p><p id=par-14_17>The Bachelor airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
