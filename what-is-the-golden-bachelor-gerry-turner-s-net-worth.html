While Gerry’s public life isn’t as documented as other celebrities, we do know enough about his past to get an idea just how deep his pockets are.</p><h2 id=h-so-what-is-gerry-turner-s-net-worth-and-how-did-he-make-his-money data-injectable=false>So what is Gerry Turner’s net worth and how did he make his money?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gerry-Turner-on-The-Golden-Bachelor.jpg><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Various sources currently estimate Gerry Turner’s net worth at around $1.5 million. According to his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">official ABC profile</a>, Gerry is “a retired restaurateur” which is likely how he made most of his money. Those who live in Michigan may know the Mr. Quick restaurant chain, of which Gerry owned and operated five locations for just over 14 years of his life.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=806 data-injectable=true>That reasonably could have left him quite a bit of money to retire on, but he just kept on working hard. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his LinkedIn page</a>, Gerry has had jobs with titles like director of sales and marketing for Rock River Provision and was the senior operator for several Brueggers locations in Iowa. Most of his jobs have put him in high end positions in the food service industry over the years, and likely lined his pockets nicely.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true>As for his real estate holdings, Gerry lives on Big Long Lake in LaGrange County, Indiana. According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">United States Census</a>, the median income for the area Gerry lives in is about $75,624 a year. This low number alongside the big money it seems Gerry has made previously suggests he’s made the smart decision to live somewhere his money will go farther, as it has a lower cost of living than other areas.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Let’s also not forget that the leads on The Bachelor are often paid at least $100,000 for their time on the show, which would certainly look good in any bank account! It’s unknown if his presence on the show will lead to future business opportunities, but these would likely only increase his net worth with time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXam1pnnGqKOdnZ5ir6Kvx56jqKpdnLKzvthmq66qnpq%2FtHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
