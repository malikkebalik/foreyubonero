Many cast members come from historic, wealthy families from their area. But the franchise does a great job of integrating up and coming professionals too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Southern-Charm-1-2.jpg><p id=par-3_28>Most of the cast members have a significant net worth, but some cast members are extremely wealthy. Who is the richest cast member out of all the franchises?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cast members make bank in all three franchises</h2><p id=par-4_68>Several of the Southern Charm New Orleans cast members are making bank. Barry Smith and Tamica Lee are the total power couple in the area. Lee is a <a href=#>local entertainment reporter</a> and Smith <a href=#>owns</a> FUEL Center of Fitness, which is in growth mode. The show also features professional football player Jeff Charleston. Charleston’s football salary likely netted him a decent windfall from his football career and endorsements.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/rchar2.jpg><p id=par-5_58>Southern Charm Savannah is still <a href=#>hanging in the balance</a> as to whether the show will return or not. But if the show does not return, most of the cast won’t have to worry about finances. Cast members like Daniel Eichholz and Lyle Mackenzie have steady, well-paying jobs. Meanwhile, Louis Oswald’s <a href=#>sock business</a> appears to be taking off.</p><p id=par-6_40>But as of now, the true old money (big money) remains rooted in the Charleston show. Several cast members report net worth into the millions of dollars. Of course, though one cast member is set apart from the rest.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She’s the matriarch of the series</h2><p id=par-7_78>Without a doubt, Patricia Altschul from Southern Charm (Charleston) leads the pack with the <a href=#>highest net worth</a>. Altschul is worth a reported $20 million, which she amassed through the years. She had a childhood filled with education and guidance from her parents. “I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and had a charmed childhood not unlike&nbsp;Leave it to Beaver&nbsp;or&nbsp;Happy Days,” she told Bravo’s The Daily Dish. “I loved to ride my bicycle, play tennis, swim, and go horseback riding.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/patricia-altschul.jpg><p id=par-8_30>Altschul attended both private and boarding school before attending George Washington University. She graduated cum laude, ultimately earned a double masters degree and became a professor at age 28.</p><p id=par-9_37>She had a series of marriages and was widowed. Altschul’s third husband Arthur died in 1996 and she hasn’t remarried since. She hinted that she was engaged last year but plans appear to be on hold.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Altschul continues to work</h2><p id=par-10_46>Despite being in her seventies, Altschul shows no sign of slowing down. She regularly appears on Southern Charm, plus she has her own textile and clothing line. She recently partnered with Craig Conover on pillow designs, plus continues to offer custom caftans&nbsp;(and more) through <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Patricia’s Couture</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-11_56>Altschul also showed the audience that she likes to save money when she can. She and butler Michael made a trip to McDonald’s during a recent episode where she still ate her meal in style. Altschul also can’t resist Popeye’s Chicken too. She admitted <a href=#>fried chicken</a> from the fast food chain is another “must have.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqbuMoqpmrJiaerO1wqGcrKxdqLy2wMeeqadlk52us7mMnJisrF2isq6uxKtkqJ5dlrmtedOhnGaeopa7pLTIrJysZpipuq17</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
