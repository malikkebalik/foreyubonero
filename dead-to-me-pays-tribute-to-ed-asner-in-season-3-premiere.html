The last season kicks off with emotion and suspense, but it does take on a somber tone at the end of its premiere. The final moments of Dead to Me Season 3’s first episode pay tribute to former cast member Ed Asner. Who did Asner play in the Netflix series, and why did it take the time to honor him?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dead-to-me-season-3-pays-tribute-to-ed-asner-at-the-end-of-its-premiere>‘Dead to Me’ Season 3 pays tribute to Ed Asner at the end of its premiere</h2><p id=par-3_60>Those who have <a href=#>watched Dead to Me Season 3</a> will notice it pays homage to Ed Asner at the very end of its premiere. As the credits roll, the words, “In memory of Ed Asner” are the first to materialize. And after the actor’s death in 2021, it makes sense the series would take the time to remember him.</p><p id=par-4_52>Asner was part of Dead to Me‘s cast back in season 1, and the Netflix show hasn’t dropped new episodes since his passing. Clearly, the actor left quite an impression on his costars and Dead to Me‘s crew — just as his character, Abe Rifkin, made an impact on Judy (Linda Cardellini).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ed-asner-portrayed-abe-rifkin-in-dead-to-me-season-1>Ed Asner portrayed Abe Rifkin in ‘Dead to Me’ Season 1</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_26>Those struggling to remember who Ed Asner played in Dead to Me may want to revisit the show’s first season after seeing its recent tribute.</p><p id=par-6_80>Asner brought Abe Rifkin to life, and Abe played a pivotal role in Judy’s character arc. Abe was one of the men Judy worked with at the assisted-living facility, and she spent a lot of time with him. The two characters became close, making Abe’s death in Dead to Me Season 1 all the more tragic. And just as Judy grieved the loss of the character, <a href=#>the Dead to Me cast</a> and crew are grappling with the loss of Asner.</p><p id=par-7_31>Of course, Dead to Me is far from the only major project Asner appears in. Fans will remember him from his other hits as well — including a beloved holiday movie.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-else-you-ve-seen-late-actor-ed-asner>Where else you’ve seen late actor Ed Asner</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_54>Those wondering where else they’ve seen the late Ed Asner after Dead to Me‘s tribute can glimpse his long and impressive acting career on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>.

He also voiced Carl Fredrickson in Pixar’s Up, a film that left many viewers in tears.</p><p id=par-10_31>Needless to say, Asner accomplished a lot with his acting career, and he left his mark on colleagues and audiences alike.
