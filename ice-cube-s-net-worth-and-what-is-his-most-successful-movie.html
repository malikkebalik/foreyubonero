Stars like Will Smith and Queen Latifah became famous for their music careers before becoming acclaimed big-screen performers. And in much the same way, <a href=#>Ice Cube proved his ability</a> to draw crowds to the theater. But after decades of success in Hollywood, what is Ice Cube’s net worth and his most popular movie? Let’s take a closer look and find out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ice-Cube-Oscars.jpg><h2 id=h-ice-cube-s-early-hits-include-boyz-n-the-hood-and-friday>Ice Cube’s early hits include ‘Boyz N the Hood’ and ‘Friday’</h2><p id=par-2_58>Following his success with N.W.A., Ice Cube launched a successful solo music career. Tracks like “It Was a Good Day” and “Check Yo Self” remain classics decades after their release. But in 1991’s Boyz N the Hood, Ice Cube launched a movie career. And just a few years later, he established himself as <a href=#>a leading man in Friday</a>.</p><p id=par-3_59>In addition to starring, Ice Cube co-wrote and produced the movie, returning to do the same for both sequels. Still, he made a ton of other hit movies, launching several franchises. Barbershop, Are We There Yet? and Ride Along all led to sequels. And Ice Cube even stepped in for Vin Diesel in 2005’s xXx: State of the Union.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-what-are-ice-cube-s-net-worth-and-his-most-popular-movie>What are Ice Cube’s net worth and his most popular movie?</h2><p id=par-4_72>But of all Ice Cube’s hit movies, the most successful are actually ones that riff successfully on his own persona. 2014’s 22 Jump Street and its 2012 predecessor, 21 Jump Street — <a href=#>based on the TV series</a> — are his highest-grossing movies. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The-Numbers.com</a>, the films earned $331 million and $202 million worldwide, respectively. Ride Along, Anaconda, and Ride Along 2 round out the top five hits in Ice Cube’s filmography.</p><p id=par-5_73>As for Ice Cube’s net worth, the rapper/actor is reportedly worth $160 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. That total, of course, ties to not only his music and acting careers. Since the early 2000s, Ice Cube has produced more than 15 movies, likely entitling him to a bigger chunk of their box office takes. Perhaps most notably, he produced the Oscar-nominated N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton from Friday director F. Gary Gray.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-the-actor-isn-t-done-with-a-few-of-his-biggest-franchise-roles>The actor isn’t done with a few of his biggest franchise roles</h2><p id=par-6_71>By the looks of it, Ice Cube isn’t done with some of his franchise roles. Ride Along 3 has been announced, though development appears to be moving slowly. Ice Cube also returned for xXx: Return of Xander Cage alongside Diesel. And although <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> reports a new female-led Jump Street film promises to bring in new characters, it’s easy to see where an Ice Cube cameo or supporting role might fit in.</p><p id=par-7_70>And then there’s Last Friday. For years, <a href=#>Ice Cube has had a fourth</a> and final film in the franchise in development. But after more than 25 years, chances are slim original co-star Chris Tucker will finally be willing to return. Perhaps Ice Cube might still make it with Mike Epps and other returning supporting players. But right now, something seems certain with regards to Ice Cube’s most mysterious movie project.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS2pLGMnKybnV2jsrV51qipraBdory0wIysrJyblajAp8HLZqSorpmae6nAzKVm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
