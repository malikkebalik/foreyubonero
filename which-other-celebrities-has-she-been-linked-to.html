But she has been linked to several men, many of whom are also famous. This includes a relationship with <a href=#>the late Heath Ledger</a>. Who else had Graham dated, aside from the&nbsp;Brokeback Mountain&nbsp;star?</p><h2 id=h-james-woods><strong>James Woods&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/heather-graham-james-woods.jpg><p id=par-2_48>Graham began acting in the 1980s. Early films include&nbsp;License to Drive,&nbsp;Drugstore Cowboy, and&nbsp;Shout. She earned a recurring role in the drama series&nbsp;<a href=#>Twin Peaks</a>. In 1992, she appeared in the sports comedy&nbsp;Diggstown, which starred James Woods as a con man. She and Woods reportedly dated for about a year.</p><p id=par-3_56>Woods and Graham are about 20 years apart in age. At the time they were together, she was in her early 20s. In 2000, Woods told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Movieline</a>&nbsp;that he “had a wonderful time,” while Graham later “said something like, ‘I don’t know what I was doing. I must have been looking for a father figure'” of their relationship.</p><h2 id=h-edward-burns><strong>Edward Burns&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/heather-graham-edward-burns.jpg><p id=par-4_49>After several more movies, Graham skyrocketed to fame with her role in the hit period drama&nbsp;Boogie Nights. A little after this film came out, she began dating&nbsp;<a href=#>Saving Private Ryan</a>&nbsp;actor Edward Burns. They were photographed together in 1998, and attended numerous premieres and award shows over the next two years.</p><p id=par-5_50>Burns and Graham broke up in 2000. But before their split, they starred in&nbsp;Sidewalks of New York, which Burns also wrote, directed, and produced. In the movie, Graham’s character Annie connects with Burns’ Tommy, as she’s in an unhappy marriage. Graham assured&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cinema.com</a>&nbsp;the plot “had nothing to do with our relationship.”</p><h2 id=h-heath-ledger><strong>Heath Ledger&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/heather-graham-heath-ledger.jpg><p id=par-6_53>After Graham and Burns broke up, she went to Prague, Czech Republic, to film the horror film&nbsp;From Hell. While she was there, she started dating Ledger, who was filming&nbsp;A Knight’s Tale&nbsp;on the same studio lot. Their romance continued after returning to the United States, but they split in 2001 after a year together.</p><p id=par-7_49>Many years after <a href=#>Ledger’s 2008 death</a>, Graham spoke about their relationship. “Going through my photos I found these,” she wrote in an Instagram post shared in February 2021, including the above pic from filming in Prague. “Just remembering this time. Heath Ledger was such a special person,” she added.</p><h2 id=h-matthew-perry><strong>Matthew Perry&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/heather-graham-matthew-perry.jpg><p id=par-8_59>Though Graham told Cinema.com she was “gonna try” to “date somebody who’s not in this same world” as her (referring to show business), this resolve didn’t hold strong for too long. Late in 2002, she was linked to&nbsp;<a href=#>Friends&nbsp;star Matthew Perry</a>, who was, at the time, one of the most sought-after names in Hollywood. But their relationship didn’t last long.</p><h2 id=h-chris-weitz><strong>Chris Weitz</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/heather-graham-chris-weitz.jpg><p id=par-9_56>In January 2003, Graham attended the Golden Globes with boyfriend Chris Weitz, who was nominated for Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy for the 2002 film&nbsp;About a Boy, which he co-directed. And two months later, she joined him at the Academy Awards, where the movie was also nominated. Graham and Weitz broke up in 2004.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1pq3ToZyrZZenrqmtzGabmqyVmXqpscCtn2aklZm0pr6MqKuhnaJisKa4xJupoqyZmsBvtNOmo2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
