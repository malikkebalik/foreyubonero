From sweet charm bracelets to sparkly statement rings, jewelry like Pandora serves up all the style you love at more affordable prices — and since all these Pandora alternatives are on Amazon, you won’t have to wait more than a couple of days to start styling them.</p><h2>How To Shop For Jewelry Like Pandora</h2><p>While not exact copies, every item on this list has a few qualities in common with your Pandora favorites. Bracelets crafted from sterling silver will feel of comparable Pandora quality, while a charm bracelet with a dangling heart or a stackable, snake-style band will channel the Pandora look you love. If you adore the way Pandora injects sparkle into their designs, choose a piece studded with cubic zirconia rather than real gemstones to channel the Pandora look while keeping costs down. And if you love Pandora but you’re more of a minimalist, try a silver bead bracelet for some fun Pandora texture, minus the sparkle.</p><p>Many of Pandora’s best-sellers (and what likely won your adoration) are their charm bracelets, charms, and sparkly pendants and rings. These pieces tend to be made of sterling silver, embellished with special details like snake chains, barrel clasps, pave encrusting, and cubic zirconia or colorful gemstone studding. Hearts feature prominently in Pandora designs, and many of their charms have a personal, playful quality that can inject personality into your outfit, signaling love for anything from movie characters to pets.</p><p>From signature stretchy bracelets to elegant pendants and playful charms, there’s a piece of jewelry like Pandora out there just waiting for you to spot it. Scroll on to start shopping.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">1</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">This Popular Crystal Pave Charm Bracelet With A Stretchy Band</h2></p><p>Fans of Pandora charm bracelets, take note: This <a href=# rel=noreferrer>bracelet</a> features a stretchy popcorn-chain silver-toned band, embellished by a crystal pave heart, for a look that feels distinctly rooted in Pandora style at a lower price.

The teardrop ring features a 1.5-carat cubic zirconia stone set in a sterling silver band surrounded by tiny CZ stones, and the matching band is studded in CZ stones all the way around. Lots of shoppers wear this as their engagement ring and wedding band, but it’s also a gorgeous option for dressier events. Choose from white-, yellow-, or rose gold-toned settings.</p><p><strong>Positive review</strong>: “This wedding ring set is GORGEOUS, right out of the box! [...] This is a wedding set I got to wear everyday, because if I try to take off my ring whenever I go to work, take a shower or wash my hands, or cook, then I am much more likely to lose it! So I ordered this one and slipped it on and don't take it off! The little tiny stones that surround the teardrop stone are well-set, And the ring is sturdy enough to not get smashed or misshapen, unlike every other set that I've had before! [...] I can't say enough great things about this ring. I'm so glad I chose it out of the sea of options here on Amazon!”</p><p><strong>Sizes:</strong> 3 — 11 | <strong>Styles:</strong> 3 | <strong>Material:</strong> Sterling Silver, Cubic Zirconia</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">5</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">A Sterling Silver Barrel Clasp Bracelet</h2></p><p>This <a href=# rel=noreferrer>charm bracelet</a> is made of sterling silver and features a snake-style chain that looks gorgeous on its own, or can accommodate a collection of charms<strong> </strong>(either the brand’s own <a href=# rel=noreferrer>line of charms</a> or Pandora charms — one reviewer noted that Pandora charms fit this piece) to personalize your look. The barrel clasp is encrusted in sparkling pave, and it clasps securely to ensure that any charms you might add to it won’t slip off. (It comes in a few other clasp designs, too.) It feels every bit as special as your favorite Pandora pieces, at a very wallet-friendly price. Try layering it with other bracelets, and adding in other charms, to personalize your look.</p><p><strong>Positive review</strong>: “Perfect fit for Pandora-styled charms.

While it’s available in your birthstone of choice (plus one with a rose design, and another with both a rose and a heart), there’s nothing wrong with purchasing the color that happens to be your favorite.</p><p><strong>Positive review</strong>: “I truly liked this ring not only is it a perfect accessory for any occasion, its small but cute and it being adjustable makes it so much better. It's a meaningful gift for anyone or yourself.”</p><p><strong>Sizes:</strong> 1 | <strong>Styles</strong>: 14 | <strong>Material:</strong> 18 Karat Gold-Plated Sterling Silver, Cubic Zirconia</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">7</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">This Classic Tennis Bracelet With Over 15,000 5-Star Ratings</h2></p><p>Pavoi jewelry has earned a cult following in its own right, and this classic <a href=# rel=noreferrer>tennis bracelet</a> taps into the sparkle of Pandora tennis bracelets, at a fraction of the cost (plus it’s got over 15,000 five-star Amazon ratings to back it up). Crafted with cubic zirconia set into 14 karat gold-plated sterling silver, this bracelet looks elegant on its own, but it’s perfect for layering with other bracelets for even more texture — it’s a gorgeous choice for minimalists and maximalists alike.
