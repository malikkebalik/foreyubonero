Black stocking garters and white skin, that is. She is the legend in the fetish model genre. In the 60s, Page stopped having her picture taken for the most part, so in most people’s mind, she is still the gorgeous woman with the short black bangs and winning smile posing in bdsm and topless photos that her era found shocking. And that’s why the news that Ms. Bettie, now 85, is in intensive care after suffering a heart attack on Friday, is so shocking now.</p><p>Bettie Page, a 1950s pinup known for her raven-haired bangs and saucy come-hither looks, was hospitalized in intensive care after suffering a heart attack, her agent said Friday.</p><p>“She’s critically ill,” Mark Roesler of CMG Worldwide told The Associated Press.</p><p>He said the 85-year-old had been hospitalized for the last three weeks with pneumonia and was about to be released when she had the heart attack Tuesday. Page was transferred to another hospital in Los Angeles and remained in intensive care Friday.</p><p>A family friend, Todd Mueller, said Page was in a coma. When asked to confirm, Roesler said, “I would not deny that,” but he would not comment further on her condition.</p><p>[From <a href=#>MSN Entertainment</a>]</p><p>Bettie Page is easily the most recognizable fetish pinup girl of all time. She is the image upon which all other pinup/fetish models are measured, and precious few can come even close. Page revolutionized the topless pinup image and brought it more into the mainstream than any other model in history. Without Bettie Page, there would be no Dita.</p><p>It’s difficult for me to comprehend that Bettie Page is 85. She’s been immortalized at a stunning 30-years old by thousands of photos, art images, tattoos, films and the movie The Notorious Bettie Page, which is a great movie if you’re a fan. I thought Gretchen Moll did an excellent job of telling Bettie’s story. A pretty girl who happened into a scene that made her an sex icon, and she was spanked with a smile!</p><p>Best wishes Bettie Page.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/bettiepage5.jpg alt title=bettiepage5 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma21ibH5wuMSgnKeckafGoLzIp6ypl5KawbW1xJinmp%2BVlLavq8icrJiZlqmys6vHnpirrI%2BWwbWtwqRm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
