For the last few decades the Terminator actor has dominated showbiz, fans have come to know and love his blended brood.</p><p>Arnold first tied the knot with <a href=#><strong>Maria Shriver</strong></a> in 1986 and the pair had four kids together: <strong>Katherine Schwarzenegger</strong>, <strong>Christina Schwarzenegger</strong>, <strong>Patrick Schwarzenegger</strong> and <strong>Christopher Schwarzenegger</strong>. The longtime couple raised their children until they split in 2011.</p><p>Following his divorce from the American journalist, it was revealed the A-lister had fathered another child 14 years earlier named <a href=#><strong>Joseph Baena</strong></a>. While that situation created some ups and downs for the famous family, Joseph couldn’t have fit in better with <a href=#>Arnold’s eldest children</a>.</p><p>The former Governor of California candidly spoke about the experience as a father during an appearance on the <a href=#>Howard Stern Show</a> in 2016. At the time, Arnold explained he navigated the situation as best as he could for the sake of his youngest son.</p><p>“[Joseph is] terrific and he totally understands,” he explained. “So, it all has worked out … It’s a very tough situation for him. It’s a very tough situation for my kids, very tough situation for my family. It was tough for everybody. But it has happened and now we have to figure it out, right?”</p><p>Since he’s effortlessly blended his family, Arnold couldn’t be more proud to be the dad of his five kids. Whether he’s <a href=#>biking around town with Patrick</a> or celebrating one of their&nbsp;impressive accomplishments, there’s no doubt the&nbsp;Predator&nbsp;star nails his role as a doting dad. He even once opened up about his “great father-son relationship” with Patrick.</p><p>“We also have a great friendship,” the former bodybuilder told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ Germany</a>. “My vision was to create great kids. What I’m proud of is that I could kind of show him the way and he knew that he has all the help in the world from me all the time but that he had to do the work also.”</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to meet all five of Arnold’s kids!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46aqaennJl6tK%2FHsJirspWjsqizxKtkpKGUqHquscStZK2glWLBpr7MoqWarJ%2BnerTAwKuqZm1dmLWquMOrnKdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
