After being discovered on YouTube in 2007, Justin Bieber has gone on to sell over 150 million records worldwide in addition to conducting a number of extremely popular and lucrative global tours. He is literally a world-wide phenomenon which has made him ridiculously, ridiculously wealthy. In touring years, Justin is one of the highest-paid entertainers on the planet, easily bringing in $60-80 million personally from all income sources. In December 2022, Justin inked a deal to sell his music catalog rights for $200 million. Justin Bieber was just a Canadian pre-teen posting videos of his songs to the internet back in 2007/2008. Then Scooter Braun, a former marketing executive, and later Bieber's manager, stumbled across his videos. The rest is history.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Bieber was born on March 1, 1994, in London, Ontario. His parents never married, and his mother was underage when she gave birth, so Bieber's maternal grandmother and step-grandfather helped raise him. Growing up, he learned to play the piano, drums, guitar and trumpet. He graduated from the St. Michael Catholic Secondary School in Stratford, Ontario, in 2012.</p><p>In early 2007, at the age of 12, Bieber sang <a href=# title="Ne-Yo Net Worth">Ne-Yo</a>'s "So Sick" in a local Stratford singing competition, placing second. His mother posted a video of the performance on YouTube so friends and relatives could see it, and continued to upload Bieber singing covers of songs.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-244582 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/GettyImages-465934438.jpg alt="Justin Bieber Wealth" width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-244582 class=wp-caption-text>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</p><h2 id=breakthrough><strong>Breakthrough</strong></h2><p>While searching for videos of a different singer, record executive <a href=#>Scooter Braun</a> accidentally clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 videos. Impressed with what he saw, he tracked Bieber down and convinced his mother to let him take Bieber to Atlanta, where he recorded some demo tapes. A week after arriving in Atlanta, Bieber was singing for R&B star <a href=# title="Usher Net Worth">Usher</a>.</p><p>Soon after, he was signed to Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), a joint venture between Braun and Usher, who helped him audition for The Island Def Jam Music Group. Bieber signed to Island Records in October 2008, and moved to Atlanta with his mother so he could continue to work with Braun and Usher. Braun became Bieber's manager in 2008.</p><p>In 2010, Bieber released a two-part debut album entitled "My World" and "My World 2.0". His promotional activities for the record included performances on several live shows such as "The Today Show," The Wendy Williams Show," "Good Morning America," and "The <a href=# title="Ellen DeGeneres Net Worth">Ellen DeGeneres</a> Show." Less than two months after its release, "My World" sold over one million albums in the US alone. To date, that album has been certified 5x platinum by the RIAA. "My World" was the first debut album to have four singles (One Time, One Less Lonely Girl, Love Me, and Favorite Girl) on the Billboard Top 40 prior to the album's release. "My World 2.0" debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 with a total of 698,000 copies sold in the first three weeks of its release. This accomplishment made Bieber the youngest solo male act to top the chart since Steven Wonder in 1963. The single "Baby" which featured rapper <a href=# title="Ludacris Net Worth">Ludacris</a>, quickly became Justin's best selling single of all time, with more than 15 million singles sold around the world. His second album, a set of Christmas songs called "Under the Mistletoe" sold 2 million copies. His third album, 2012's "Believe" sold 3 million copies worldwide.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-141821 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/justin.jpg alt="Justin Bieber Net Worth" width=670 height=476 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-141821 class=wp-caption-text>Justin Bieber Net Worth â€“ (MIGUEL MEDINA/AFP/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=music-career><strong>Music Career</strong></h2><p>As Bieber's star continued to grow, his 3D part-biopic, part-concert film "Justin Bieber: Never Say Never" was released in February 2011. The film topped the box office with an estimated gross of $12.4 million on its opening day from 3,105 theaters, and grossing a total of over $98 million worldwide. Along with the film, Bieber released the album "Never Say Never â€“ The Remixes" (Feb. 2011). In June 2011, he was featured as number two on the Forbes list of Best-Paid Celebrities under 30, having made $53 million in a 12-month period.</p><p>Christmas album "Under the Mistletoe" was released in October 2011 to great success, followed by "Believe" in June 2012 and "Believe Acoustic" in January 2013. "Justin Bieber's Believe," a follow-up to his first film, was released in December 2013, also directed by Jon M. Chu. His February 2015 song "Where Are Ãœ Now" won a Grammy Award in 2016 for Best Dance Recording. Bieber earned a Guinness World Record for youngest male artist to debut at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart with his single "What Do You Mean" off of his album "Purpose" (Nov. 2015). &nbsp;His follow-up album "Changes" was release on February 14, 2020.</p><p>Bieber released his sixth studio album, "Justice," in 2021, marking a return to his pop roots. The album made him the youngest solo artist to have eight US number one albums, passing <a href=# title="Elvis Net Worth">Elvis</a> Presley. In January 2022, he set the then-record for most monthly listeners in Spotify history at 94.68 million.</p><p>Other notable single and collaborations he has worked on include "Cold Water" (2016) with Major Lazer and MÃ˜, "DÃ©jÃ  vu" (2016) with Post Malone, "Despacito" (2017) with Luis Fonsi and <a href=# title="Daddy Yankee Net Worth">Daddy Yankee</a>, "I'm the One" (2017) with Quavo, Chance the Rapper, <a href=# title="Lil Wayne Net Worth">Lil Wayne</a> and <a href=# title="DJ Khaled Net Worth">DJ Khaled</a>, "Bad Guy" (2019) with Billie Eilish, and "Up at Night" by Kehlani.</p><p>As of this writing, the music video for "Baby" has more than 2.9 billion views on YouTube. His music video for the song "Sorry" has more than 3.6 billion views. In total he has 71+ million subscribers on YouTube.</p><p></p><h2 id=catalog-sale><strong>Catalog Sale</strong></h2><p>In December 2022 it was revealed that Justin was on the verge of signing a $200 million deal to sell his music catalog rights to publicly-traded music investment vehicle, Hipgnosis. The deal would mean that from that point on, Hipgnosis would earn all of the money generated by Justin's songwriting credits and royalty stream. It was the largest catalog purchase Hipgnosis had signed up that point, roughly doubling the amount it paid to <a href=# title="Justin Timberlake Net Worth">Justin Timberlake</a> earlier in 2022.</p><p>The deal, which was officially confirmed in January 2023, did not include Bieber's master recordings and various other copyrights which are owned by his record company, Universal Music Group.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-187263 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/GettyImages-120069903.jpg alt width=594 height=508 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-187263 class=wp-caption-text>Christopher Polk/Getty Images for ESPN</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In December 2010, Bieber entered into a high-profile relationship with actress and singer <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>. The pair had an on-and-off relationship until March 2018.</p><p>During one of his breaks from Gomez, Bieber had briefly dated <a href=#>Hailey Baldwin</a> between December 2015 and January 2016, and the couple reconciled in May 2018. They became engaged in July 2018, and had an official wedding ceremony on September 30, 2019. Hailey is the daughter of actor <a href=# title="Stephen Baldwin Net Worth">Stephen Baldwin</a>, brother of Alec.</p><p>As a Canadian citizen, Bieber is reported to possess an O-1 visa for temporary resident status in the United States, although September 2018 reports from TMZ allege he has begun the process of becoming an American citizen following his marriage to Baldwin.</p><p>Although he has received extraordinary success in the music business, like many young celebrities, he has had his share of scandal in the press. In 2014, he was arrested for a DUI, drag racing, and resisting arrest; he was also exhibiting some erratic behavior around the time of his arrest and his popularity briefly dipped as a result of his actions.</p><p>In March of 2015, Justin volunteered himself to be roasted by Comedy Central. Some of the celebrity roasters included Kevin Hart, <a href=# title="Snoop Dogg Net Worth">Snoop Dogg</a>, Shaq, <a href=# title="Martha Stewart Net Worth">Martha Stewart</a>, Ludacris and many more. When it was all said and done, Justin ended the show with a pretty clever line:</p><p>"What do you get when you give a teenager $200 million? A bunch of has-beens calling you a lesbian for two hours."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-187260 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/GettyImages-485983930.jpg alt=Bieber width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-187260 class=wp-caption-text>Jason Merritt/Getty Images</p><h2 id=business-ventures-endorsements><strong>Business Ventures and Endorsements</strong></h2><p>Bieber's fame has enabled him to enjoy a number of lucrative business partnerships throughout the years. Companies he has worked with in Proactive, Nicole by OPI, Walmart, Adidas, Calvin Klein, and Schmidt's Naturals. He also has released several fragrances, including "Someday" (2011), "Girlfriend" (2012), and "Justin Bieber Collector's Edition" (2014).</p><p>In 2019, he released his own clothing brand called Drew House, and in 2020, collaborated with Crocs on a limited edition of the brand's footwear called Crocs x Justin Bieber. Other partnerships included Tim Hortons and Vespa. And in December 2022, Bieber launched a clean water technology company called Generosity.</p><p>In 2023, it was reported that Justin Bieber was down $1.24 million on his Bored Ape NFT investment from a year and a half ago.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber-net-worth-over><strong>Justin Bieber Net Worth Over Time</strong></h2><p>We first started tracking Justin Bieber's net worth in February 2010. At the time we estimated his net worth to be $500 thousand. This was before the smash hit success of "Baby", which essentially turned the teenager into a household name overnight. By the end of 2010, Justin's net worth topped $5 million. Between 2010 and 2011, Justin's net worth started to grow at a furious pace. On January 29, 2012, we updated his net worth to $40 million. From this point on, Justin began earning <strong>$50-70 million</strong>&nbsp;every year from music sales, merchandise, product endorsements, touring and various other business ventures. After hovering in the $170 â€“ $180 million range for a while, in July 2014, Justin's net worth officially topped $200 million.</p><ul><li>2010: $500 thousand</li><li>2011: $5 million</li><li>2012: $40 million</li><li>2013: $100 million</li><li>2014: $200 million</li><li>2015: $210 million</li><li>2016: $240 million</li><li>2017: $250 million</li><li>2018: $265 million</li><li>2019: $270 million</li><li>2020: $280 million</li><li>2021: $285 million</li><li>2022: $290 million</li><li>2023: $300 million</li></ul><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-334301 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Justin-Bieber.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1503px) 100vw, 1503px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-334301 class=wp-caption-text>(VALERY HACHE/AFP via Getty Images)</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2012, an 18-year-old Justin paid $6.5 million for a home in the exclusive Calabasas gated community called The Oaks. It was at this house where Justin had several run-ins with neighbors. Neighbors frequently complained about his loud parties and friends speeding through the quiet streets. In 2014 a neighbor's security cameras caught Justin throwing eggs at a house causing thousands of dollars worth of damage. The incident resulted in Justin being briefly detained at his home while police entered his home with a felony search warrant. After paying $80,000 to settle the controversy, Justin sold the home in 2014 for $7.2 million to <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a>.</p><p>Over the next five years, Justin lived somewhat of a vagabond life renting home after home in various parts of the world. For example, during much of 2019 they were spending a mind-altering $100,000 per month to rent a home in Toluca Lake, California.</p><p>In March 2019, Justin paid $8.5 million for a Beverly Hills mansion. It sold fully furnished in 2021 for $7.995 million.</p><p>In August 2020, Justin paid $28.5 million for a new home in Beverly Hills. This new Beverly Hills home is located high up in the mountains of Beverly Hills, within an ultra-exclusive gated community called Beverly Park. Nearby neighbors include <a href=# title="Denzel Washington Net Worth">Denzel Washington</a>, <a href=# title="Eddie Murphy Net Worth">Eddie Murphy</a>, <a href=# title="Rod Stewart Net Worth">Rod Stewart</a> and <a href=# title="Sylvester Stallone Net Worth">Sylvester Stallone</a>, to name a few.
