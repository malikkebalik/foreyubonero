However, O’Day recently spoke out about Comb’s behavior toward her while they filmed the show.</p><p id=par-2_69>Sean “P. Diddy” Combs is under the microscope after <a href=#>Homeland Security raided two of his properties</a> — one in Los Angeles, and the other in Miami.

You look great, I could f*** you now. And things like that. I don’t even remember.”</p><p id=par-4_88>O’Day spoke to her friend, who’s a therapist, about the situation. “She said she remembers when he said that to me. I said, ‘What did I do?’ She said, ‘You kind of looked at me and said, ‘He finally thinks I’m pretty,'” the singer recalled. “That was what I thought in that moment. … I think that it’s just so telling with what a woman goes through and a systemic problem, specifically right now …. You meet the person who can make your dreams come true. It’s grooming.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-danity-kane-singer-said-there-are-so-many-victims-of-p-diddy-s-abuse>The Danity Kane singer said there are ‘so many victims’ of P.

Diddy” Combs on the No Jumper podcast. She talked about the “witnesses” and “victim.”</p><p id=par-6_65>“There are so many witnesses. There are so many victims,” she continued. “If or if not there were to be any type of investigation occurring, no victim should be or can communicate with other victims. And so victims are likely not communicating with victims. But, a lot of people that know things or are building things or whatever do reach out do tell you everything.”</p><p id=par-7_17>O’Day added that she asked Combs’ former bodyguard, Gene Deal, if the hip-hop star was a “sociopath.”</p><p id=par-8_23>“That was a man that, at one point, I adored, looked up to,” she said of Combs. “He made my dreams happen.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-aubrey-o-day-fully-supports-casandra-cassie-ventura-in-her-allegations>Aubrey O’Day fully supports Casandra ‘Cassie’ Ventura in her allegations</h2><p id=par-9_37>Sean “P.

I know what her heart is feeling right now, because I have done so as well. May her voice bring all the others to the table, so we can start having more transparent conversations about what is actually happening behind the scenes.
