One: it can give you the strange urge to go shopping and buy a lot of headbands, even if you've never worn one before. Two: it can help inspire a trip into Manhattan to get a glimpse at everything New York City has to offer. Even if you already live in New York, one episode of Gossip Girl can be enough to make you want to explore the city more. The show makes Manhattan seem even more alluring than it already is, a place full of magical romantic moments, crazy dramatic scenes, and tons of luxury. Even if you can't live the life of a <a href=# class=T3D>Gossip Girl cast</a> member (and think about it: would you really want to? They have a lot going on!), you can pretend you can by visiting the spots they use as backdrops during the show. GG was filmed in New York, on location at many famous places, and there are lots of Gossip Girl New York filming locations you can actually visit in real life.</p><p>Whether you live in New York and you just want to check out more of your own city, or you're planning a vacation and want to do your own <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Gossip Girl tour</a>, the below sites are ones you definitely need to see with your very own eyes. Just be sure to plan far in advance: some of these places can be a little exclusive — what would you expect anything else from the lives of <a href=# class=T3D>Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen</a>?</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">1</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Grand Central Station</h2></p><p>The beautiful main lobby of <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Grand Central Station</a> is where we first get a glimpse of Serena — and that backdrop couldn't be more beautiful. Known as an architectural landmark as well as a bustling transportation hub, Grand Central Station is worth exploring. You can head to any of the restaurants on the upstairs balconies to people watch or go downstairs to do a little shopping.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">2</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Campbell Apartment</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5" readability=2><p>Mario Tama/Getty Images News/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Another memorable early Gossip Girl scene is that infamous Serena and <a href=#>Nate Archibald</a> affair, which happened right before Serena left town and blew up her relationship with Blair. The hookup — and Serena and Nate’s subsequent reenactment in <a href=#>Dan Humphrey</a>’s overthinking head — took place on the literal <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Campbell Apartment</a> bar, located in Grand Central Terminal. Stop in for a drink at the must-visit spot.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">3</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">New York Palace Hotel</h2></p><p>Serena and her family — along with <a href=#>Chuck Bass</a> — lived in <a href=# rel=noreferrer>the Palace Hotel</a> on Madison Avenue for a long time. The <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Lotte New York Palace</a> is not exactly the most inexpensive place to stay in the city (far from it), but it is a beautiful spot to visit if you want a taste of luxury. If you can't get a room, snap a pic in the courtyard as the restaurant GILT is no longer open.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">4</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">The Plaza Hotel’s Pulitzer Fountain</h2></p><p>After Eleanor Waldorf and her fashion team tried to trick Serena into replacing <a href=#>Blair</a> as the face of the brand, the two frenemies stole a couple of backless dresses from the rooftop photoshoot and had one of their own. If you love visiting scenic fountains, you’ll definitely want to check out the <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Plaza Hotel’s Pulitzer Fountain</a>, which is where Blair and Serena had an impromptu photoshoot with the help of a random passerby.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">5</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Veselka</h2></p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Veselka</a> is one of Dan's favorite spots for pierogis and comfort food, and it's also where Blair and Prince Louis went on a date once. Veselka is a real restaurant you can go to while you pretend to wait for Dan to come hang with you. It's an old Ukrainian restaurant located in the East Village, dating back over 60 years, and it's known for delicious food, even if it's not super fancy.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">6</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">The Metropolitan Museum of Art</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>ShutterStock</p></figure><p>The steps of the <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> are where Blair, Serena, and their friends hung out before and after school (remember, "Little J, could you move down a step?"). In real life, the Met is an incredibly popular art museum in New York that is always worth a visit. The architecture is gorgeous, and the artwork is extensive. Try to find a spot on the steps if you want to sit outside and pretend to be Blair.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">7</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">DUMBO</h2></p><p>To witness the fine, expensive neighborhood Blair dragged for filth and turned her nose up at any chance she got, cross the river and see the Humphreys’ side of town for yourself. For views of the external shots of Dan, <a href=#>Jenny</a>, Rufus, and sometimes Alison’s loft, you’ll need to head to 455 Water Street in <a href=# rel=noreferrer>DUMBO</a>, right near the Manhattan Bridge.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">8</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Museum of the City of New York</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5" readability=2><p>Warner Bros. Television Distribution</p></figure></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">9</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">The Empire Hotel</h2></p><p>In Season 3 of Gossip Girl, Chuck invests in <a href=# rel=noreferrer>The Empire Hotel</a>, which is indeed a very real hotel in New York. It's located practically right across the street from Lincoln Center. If you can't spring for a room, head up to <a href=# rel=noreferrer>The Empire Rooftop</a> for beautiful views of the city and a drink. They even have a cocktail inspired by Gossip Girl!</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">10</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Empire State Building</h2></p><p>Who could forget that scene where Blair rushes to meet Chuck on the observation deck at the <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Empire State Building</a>, minutes after he's already left? Chuck was being dramatic and the worst during that scene (like he was much of the show), but the Empire State Building is part of Gossip Girl history. If you're looking for a stunning view of Manhattan, head up there to get it.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">11</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">The Russian Tea Room</h2></p><p>The glamorous <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Russian Tea Room</a> makes a few appearances in Gossip Girl — most notably in the Season 2 episode where <a href=#>Georgina Sparks</a> is scamming Poppy — and is a very cool place to visit. Go for tea or some food, but be prepared to make your reservations far in advance as this “enchanting, magical place” has a 94-year reputation as one of the best spots in town.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">12</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Central Park Fountain</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5" readability=2><p>Spencer Platt/Getty Images News/Getty Images</p></figure><p>A lot of major Gossip Girl scenes happened in Central Park — especially near the iconic <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Bethesda Fountain</a>. Serena and Blair once made up by the fountain after that fight in which Blair tried to embarrass Serena in front of the Ivy Leave school reps, and it's also where <a href=#>Chuck and Blair</a> eventually get married. Take a stroll through the area to see it yourself.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">13</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">King Cole Bar</h2></p><p>According to Serena, the best “Red Snapper,” aka a Bloody Mary, in New York can be found at the <a href=# rel=noreferrer>King Cole Bar</a>. And it must be true because the restaurant, which is is located in the swanky St. Regis New York hotel, boasts just as much on its website. While it temporarily closed during the pandemic — like Blair’s favorite <a href=# rel=noreferrer>The Modern</a> — King Cole Bar typically serves a range of light bites. That is, unless you scored the coveted Table 55, which enjoys “exclusive chef’s custom-designed menu and a bespoke wine list from the hotel’s coveted cellar.”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">14</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Barrio Chino</h2></p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Barrio Chino</a> is a real Mexican restaurant on Broome Street in New York, and also the place that Serena spent a Thanksgiving afternoon in 2006 after drinking her family woes away. Right outside Barrio Chino is where Dan saved Serena from being hit by a taxi and sacrificed his family’s pie in the process. Serena didn’t remember the moment, but it certainly left a lasting impression on Dan, who hinted at it during the first Thanksgiving together.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">15</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Synod Of Bishops Russian Orthodox Church</h2></p><p>You already know the exterior of St. Jude's is filmed at the Museum of the City of New York, but the interior was filmed a few blocks south in the <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Synod of Bishops Russian Orthodox Church</a>, which features an <a href=# rel=noreferrer>administrative building</a> and two connected churches. You can head over there to see it yourself and get a feel for Dan, Nate, and Chuck’s old stomping grounds.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">16</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">St. James Church</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5" readability=2><p>Matthew Peyton/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Remember the first time Blair married? Her scandalous wedding to <a href=#>Prince Louis</a> happened at the beautiful St. James Church on the Upper East Side. Though Blair’s marriage was short-lived, thanks to her undying feelings for Chuck, this church has been standing since 1810. You can take in the beautiful architecture and design for free, and a visit will also double as an opportunity to see where famed author <a href=# rel=noreferrer>John Steinbeck requested his funeral to be held</a>.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">17</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum</h2></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">18</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Butter</h2></p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Butter</a> is the spot among the NYC prep school elite on TV. Err, except for when it was declared in Season 1 that “not going to Butter is so much better than going to Butter” and Jenny and her group of fair-weather sidekicks trick Blair into going alone. Located in Midtown, the softly lit restaurant and bar will serve as a worthy dining experience for any superfan looking for a taste of the sweet life.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">19</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Henri Bendel</h2></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">20</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">“Ehrlich Residence Hall”</h2></p><p>Can you even say you went on a Gossip Girl NYC tour if you don’t stop over at <a href=# rel=noreferrer>NYU’s campus</a>? Since it’s extremely ill-advised and creepy to try to sneak into a college dorm that is not your own, if you don’t have a key card, don’t even attempt to access the roof of “Ehrlich Residence Hall,” which many believe to be <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Rubin Hall</a> on Fifth Ave. Instead, just soak up the Dan and Blair collegiate vibes by hanging around Washington Square Park, which is basically the university’s quad.</p></figure><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p>This article was originally published on Jan. 8, 2019</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC4yJ%2BcaJ%2BfqMCqvIygoKukXZu2rbnIp55mpJ%2BYrrW1zqeqZqaVrHq6u9GkZJyhpK4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
