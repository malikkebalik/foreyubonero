Adam and Danielle have their <a href=#>older daughter, Blayke</a>, who has helped take care of the quints at times, but it’s been a wild ride for this family of eight.</p><p id=par-2_25>While plenty of people love the Busby girls, some viewers have noticed something they believe could be a cause for concern with the young girls.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-outdaughtered-viewers-call-out-the-quints-baby-voices>‘OutDaughtered’ viewers call out the quints’ baby voices</h2><p id=par-3_104>Adam and Danielle Busby have made history for having the first all-female set of quintuplets in the United States. TLC has a number of shows that center around large families, so it only makes sense that the Busbys share their story on television. Fans have watched the five daughters grow, and now, they’re ready to enter third grade in the show’s newest season. Despite that all of the girls seem to be doing well, some viewers are concerned with the way they speak, calling it a “baby voice” that the girls should have grown out of by now. They took to <a href=#>Reddit</a> to discuss.</p><p id=par-4_32>“I couldn’t even sit through a minute of Adam’s back to school interview video because they all sound like they’re 3 when they’re now 8 years old,” one user posted to Reddit.</p><p id=par-5_20>“It’s so bad that I cannot understand them,” another person wrote. TLC does occasionally use subtitles when the girls talk.</p><p id=par-6_27>“They sound foolish and very hard to understand,” someone else commented, adding that the girls might be “in speech therapy” if they talk that way at school.</p><p id=par-7_52>A few viewers questioned whether the kids could have a delay in speech, but any health or developmental delays or problems have the right to be private, and Showbiz Cheat Sheet does not want to speculate. No matter the reason, it’s caught the attention of viewers and has raised concern from some.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-outdaughtered-quints-are-growing-up-on-camera>The ‘OutDaughtered’ quints are growing up on camera</h2><p id=par-8_75>It’s not so easy to be filmed from the time you’re a baby, but the quints don’t seem to mind the cameras much at all. Adam and Danielle have said in the past that they are thankful they were given the opportunity to showcase their lives on camera because it’s given them plenty of footage that their kids will have down the road; they have said that it’s the true reason <a href=#>they agreed to film</a>.</p><p id=par-9_49>“It’s all there for them to see and enjoy, and it’s a very unique experience for sure,” Adam said in an interview with <a href=#>The List</a>. “I would give anything to be able to go back and see how my dad interacted with my grandfather whenever he was a kid.”</p><p id=par-10_31>Adam and Danielle are focused this season on tackling parenting even further, and they’re debating hiring some help due to the chaos of <a href=#>owning their own businesses</a> and raising seven children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS8tsDDmqygoKSav6awjK%2Bgnq%2BVp8BuucCknGabn6Owpr7NoqWgZZ%2BXwKa%2B1ZqroqeeYq6ju9StZKqtmaPBtHnSqGSbmZRjtbW5y2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
