According to the National Sleep Foundation, warming up your feet and hands can <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>initiate a process called vasodilation</a> (widening of the blood vessels) which can help prepare your brain for sleep. The best socks for sleeping regulate your body temperature, keep your feet warm, and don't itch or bunch throughout the night. Given how many pairs fit this bill, what should you look for in a warm sleeping sock?</p><p>The key to good sleeping socks is in the fabric. Any socks that are too tight or compress your feet can make you uncomfortable enough to pull them off in the middle of the night. When shopping for socks you can sleep in, be on the lookout for fabrics that have a little bit of spandex or elastane blended in so they stay in place without feeling too restrictive.</p><p>And, of course, only the <a href=# class=T3D>softest socks</a> will do when you're drifting to dreamland. Luxe fabrics like merino wool and microfiber are soft and comfy, yet they aren't so thick that they'll make your feet sweat. You could even splurge on a pair of cashmere socks that are so ridiculously soft that you'll want to <a href=# class=T3D>keep them on in the morning</a>.</p><p>Here's a roundup of some of the best socks for sleeping to make sure you snag the perfect pair.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">1</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">Cashmere Sleeping Socks: Mongolia Pure Cashmere Socks</h2></p><p>These <a href=# rel=noreferrer>cashmere socks</a> are made from some of the softest cashmere imported from the Mongolian grasslands, and they also feature a seamless toe so you won't feel any rubbing or pinching while you snooze. Constructed with 3% elastane, these socks have a bit of stretch around the hem at the mid-calf so you won't get those weird indentations on your skin after wearing these for a while.</p><p><strong>One fan wrote: </strong>“I bought one pair to sleep in, because my feet are always cold. They fit me perfectly (I'm a size US 7 women's), and they're so comfortable, I just bought a whole bunch more pairs in different colors. They're soft (but they're still socks -- don't expect fuzzy cashmere sweaters for your feet). They're thick enough to be cozy but thin enough to wear with my regular shoes. The elastic is form-fitting without being too tight. Very pleased, especially for the price.”</p><ul><li>Available sizes: 5 — 10, 7 — 12</li><li>Available colors: 9</li></ul></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">2</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">Thicker Merino Wool Socks For Sleeping: Smartwool Cable II Socks</h2></p><p>Not only are these <a href=# rel=noreferrer>merino wool socks</a> super soft, but they can keep your feet from overheating at night.

These socks also feature 2% elastane, helping them gently conform to your feet without hugging them too tightly.</p><p><strong>One fan wrote: </strong>“These are four season socks.

Reviewers swear by these socks for cold nights especially.</p><p><strong>One fan wrote:</strong> “I’ve been looking for replacements for some really warm sleep socks I bought about 15 years ago.

These aren’t so thick that they make you overly warm. I wear them with the thicker separator between my smallest two toes, as my pinky toe is my problem one that is going in. The first night I was ‘aware’ that I had them on, but now I don’t even notice. It’s a great way to work on correcting toes for a long period of time, without disruption. I feel overtime I will for sure notice improvement”</p><ul><li>Available sizes: One size</li></ul></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">7</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">Colorful And Cozy Wool-Blend Socks: EBMORE Wool Socks</h2></p><p>Not only are these <a href=# rel=noreferrer>wool-blend socks</a> super cozy, but they’re also temperature-regulating and breathable to help keep you comfy while you sleep.
