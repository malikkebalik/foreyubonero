Leo took the best and went on to date a string of babes — supermodels&nbsp;<strong>Gisele Bundchen</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Bar Refaeli</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Erin Heatherton</strong>, etc. — but never got serious enough to tie the knot.”</p><p>This type of bet is not uncommon in Hollywood, especially with forever bachelors like <strong>George Clooney</strong> and Leo. George has even admitted to making bets with his colleagues and friends about not getting married and having children, and they’ve had to pay up each time.</p><p>The source also adds, “Now, with his 40th just 11 months away, Tobey and Ben are sweating big-time about coughing up a staggering quarter of a million bucks each!”</p><p>I doubt Tobey and Ben would make a quarter million bet each – they’re rich, but not SO rich that they’d be willing to throw away a quarter million dollars on a bet when they could be spending it on their family or children. Also, Tobey knows Leo better than anyone, having started acting with him at a very young age and staying best friends through <a rel=nofollow href=#>the whole ‘pussy posse’ era</a>. More than anyone else, he’s privy to Leo’s <a rel=nofollow href=#>forever bachelor ways, </a>and I doubt he would have made a bet that he’d know he would eventually lose.</p><p>What do you guys think? Could Tobey and Ben actually have made a bet with Leo on this topic, and do you think it would have been for such a high amount of money?
