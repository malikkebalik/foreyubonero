But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> star <strong>Dave Bautista</strong> has gone one step further by not just donating money, but having Floyd’s now-iconic last words “I Can’t Breath” and “We the People” inked on his hands.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=65 data-current-count=65 data-injectable=false>He shared a photo of the tattoo on Twitter and captioned it with:</p><p>“Be relentless in the pursuit of justice. Unintimidated in the fight against oppression. We’re together to remind each other what we’re fighting for. I want to forget.I won’t let myself. There’s too much at stake. Peace to everyone fighting for a dream. <span class=PrettyLink-prefix>#</span><span class=PrettyLink-value>OneNation</span> <span class=PrettyLink-prefix>#</span><span class=PrettyLink-value>OneRace”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EaW2w68XkAIVJzW.jpg><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true>Bautista’s unambiguous support of BLM doesn’t come as a surprise, of course. A flick through his Twitter timeline over the last few weeks will see videos criticizing the police and retweets of progressive politicians like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Beyond that, there’s a litany of venom directed at President Donald Trump, with Bautista <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not mincing words when it comes to the Commander-in-Chief</a>:</p><p>“Try picturing President Dumb-Dumb tweeting this naked (great big mushy butt and that big sloppy gut hanging over his tiny little mushroom)eating a ham&cheese sandwich(crumbs on his man boobs)trying to figure out how to spell Pocahontas Face with tears of joy. I.e. he’s pathetic,” tweeted the actor.</p><p data-characters=37 data-current-count=37 data-injectable=false>What a lovely image. Thanks for that.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>Bautista is notoriously outspoken whenever he feels like an injustice is committed. In fact, he can get so passionate that many assumed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his fierce criticism of Disney when they temporarily fired James Gunn</a> (who clapped his new tattoo) from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</a>&nbsp;would prevent him from ever working with the studio again. That obviously didn’t happen, though.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false><strong>Dave Bautista</strong> will no doubt be preparing to return as Drax, but we don’t know when the next Guardians film is set to shoot. In the meantime, his latest effort, My Spy, is landing on Amazon Prime on June 26th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonq6Zopm2orrSZp6apJGtxm6%2F05qpZpyRq7JursCuq6KrpJZ6ta3TraaoZaOdvLh50q6nqaeiqXqjuMxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
