Late summer is when teams start separating themselves between contending for championships and rebuilding their rosters. Teams like the Chicago Cubs blew things up, trading away their stars <a href=# rel=noopener>Anthony Rizzo</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Kris Bryant</a>, and Javy Baez in the span of about 24 hours. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Dodgers are trying to repeat as champions, so they're making moves for additional pieces to help them once again reach the World Series.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>One of those pieces is 37-year-old pitcher <a href=# rel=noopener>Cole Hamels</a>. On August 4, the Dodgers signed him to a deal worth $1 million guaranteed. The contract also pays Hamels $200,000 per start.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Or, it would have, but unfortunately Hamels suffered a shoulder injury and is now on the 60-day injured list. Just like that, Hamels' season is over, 12 days and one simulated start after it began.</span></p><p>A million bucks for no work.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-322913 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1272891246.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-322913 class=wp-caption-text>Rob Carr/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This is the second year in a row Hamels' season has been cut tremendously short by injuries. He signed a one-year, $18 million contract with the Atlanta Braves in 2020. He did make one start that year, pitching 3.1 innings before another shoulder injury sidelined him for the remainder of the season.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In total, Hamels has made $19.1 million for just 3.1 innings of work over two years. Not a bad gig if you can find it!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Of course, Hamels is understandably frustrated with how things have turned out. He's on the tail end of his career and has now gone through two tough injuries. It's possible may not get another chance to pitch in the major leagues again.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But Hamels has had a 15-year career with plenty of highlights, including a World Series victory, World Series MVP, and four All-Star appearances. And he's still making good money even while injured. That's something a lot of players shoot for and never achieve.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2fnmWUpLGosdGsZKmZmZl6pLvLnmShmZ2aubR5kGakoqScnryvedOoZK2goqTEbrHXmpqtpKlix6a%2Bzmagp6aZo7S0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
