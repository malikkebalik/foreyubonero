Jimmy has previously estimated his net worth to be "in the ballpark" of $100 million. However, that net worth does not include the value of his famous home, the Sheats-Goldstein Residence. That residence is worth AT LEAST $100 million on its own. Perhaps much more. While he's alive, we include the value of the home when calculating Jimmy Goldstein's net worth. As we detail later, upon his death the home will be donated to the LA County Museum.</p><p>Jimmy Goldstein earned a fortune thanks to real estate in California, primarily mobile home parks. Outside of his real estate fortune, Goldstein has become famous for attending NBA games in colorful and eccentric outfits. He attends more than 100 NBA games a year and has reportedly not missed an NBA finals game since the early 1990s.</p><p>He is also known for owning the Sheats-Goldstein Residence in Los Angeles which has been used in many films, TV shows and photo shoots. The Sheats-Goldstein Residence was one of the primary filming locations in the 1998 movie, "The Big Lebowski."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>James F. Goldstein was born on January 5, 1940 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Nanette and C. Ellis Goldstein. His father owned a department store in Racine called Zahn's. Jimmy would later attribute his flashy clothing as a backlash to his father's stodgy and formal dressing habits.</p><p>Wisconsin was home to famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright. There are three Frank Lloyd Wright properties in Racine, Wisconsin. This is how Jimmy was exposed and became passionate about architecture.</p><p>As a kid Jimmy became enthralled by basketball. At the age of 15 he was hired by the Milwaukee Hawks to sit courtside and keep game stats. Describing this experience decades later:</p><p>"<strong>Once I did that and sat courtside for the games, I was totally hooked. My entire life has been devoted to professional basketball since then. I have such a passion for the game. I think there's more athleticism displayed in basketball than in any other sport.</strong>"</p><p>Jimmy played basketball at Nicolet High School then enrolled at Stanford University where he studied mathematics and physics. He then earned an MBA at UCLA. According to legend, during his time at UCLA, Jimmy was engaged in a 6-month affair with actress <a href=# title="Jayne Mansfield Net Worth">Jayne Mansfield</a>, who was not only eight years his senior but also married at the time to body builder Mickey Hargitay.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-264053 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Jimmy-Goldstein.jpg alt width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-264053 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=mobile-home-empire><strong>Mobile Home Empire</strong></h2><p>After graduating from UCLA in 1964 Jimmy joined a company called Rammco Investment Corporation. Rammco made a fortune in the late 60s buying cheap farmland on the outskirts of LA then developing it into neighborhoods. Jimmy's job was to find acquisition targets in Riverside and San Bernardino.</p><p>Through this job, Jimmy was exposed to the surprisingly-lucrative world of mobile home park ownership. In the early 1980s, Jimmy formed his own real estate investment company and set about acquiring properties.</p><p>To this day he reportedly owns at least a dozen mobile home parks in both Northern and Southern California which provides his primary source of income. For example, in 2007 he bought a mobile home park in Carson, California, for $23 million, using $18 million worth of financing.</p><p>Jimmy has stirred controversy with his management style at some of these mobile home parks. Mobile home parks are typically rent controlled, but Jimmy has consistently fought to raise rents at his properties. He has successfully sued several cities that attempted to block his rent increases. He has also stirred trouble by using an 1893 law that allows landowners to subdivide their properties into separate cities. Using this strategy, Jimmy has been able to force his tenants to either buy their properties from Jimmy or move out, at which point he is free to raise rents.</p><p>A notable lawsuit involved the city of Carson, California, near LAX airport. Jimmy's legal battle with Carson lasted from 2005 to 2015. The city reportedly spent more than $3 million on legal fees over the years. In the end the suit went all the way up to California's State Supreme Court, which actually sided against Goldstein.</p><p>In some interviews, Jimmy has implied that he sold the land underneath what eventually became Los Angeles' opulent Century City mall, but this is unconfirmed.</p><p>Jimmy's business card reads:</p><ul><li><strong>Fashion</strong></li><li><strong>Architecture</strong></li><li><strong>Basketball</strong></li></ul><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-347669 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jimmy-goldstein-business-card.jpg alt width=900 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 1524px) 100vw, 1524px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-347669 class=wp-caption-text>Jimmy Goldstein's business card</p><h2 id=nba-super-fan><strong>NBA Super Fan</strong></h2><p>Jimmy Goldstein is probably most famous for being a permanent fixture at NBA games where he is seen in the best seats wearing extremely gaudy outfits. He typically attends over 100 games a season both in his home state of California and all around the country. He can be seen on sidelines usually wearing outrageous outfits. His outfits are best described as "cowboy couture" and are made by designers such as John Paul Gaultier and <a href=# title="Roberto Cavalli Net Worth">Roberto Cavalli</a>.</p><p>Jimmy reportedly spends over $500 thousand every year to purchase sports tickets and travel to games. He has season ticket <a href=#>floor seats at both LA Lakers and LA Clippers games</a>. He has not missed an NBA finals game since the early 1990s.</p><p>Interestingly, despite living in Los Angeles and having courtside seats to the Lakers, he is famously NOT a Lakers fan.</p><p>As the late NBA commissioner <a href=# title="David Stern Net Worth">David Stern</a> once stated:</p><p>"<strong>He probably has the largest investment of any fan in America, so get a kick out of him. He has got quite a flair and we love him as sort of a superfan.</strong>"</p><p>After donating a substantial amount of money to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, there is now an exhibit named in his honor. The "James E. Goldstein SuperFan Gallery" is dedicated to celebrating the NBA's most iconic fans.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-189220 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/jimmy.jpg alt="Jimmy Goldstein" width=900 height=702 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-189220 class=wp-caption-text>Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images</p><h2 id=jimmy-goldstein8217s-big-lebowski-house><strong>Jimmy Goldstein's Big Lebowski House</strong></h2><p>Jimmy is also famous for owning an opulent house in the Hollywood Hills that has been featured in many movies and TV shows, notably "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle" and "The Big Lebowski." In "The Big Lebowski" the home was the residence of porn king Jackie Treehorn. The home is rented out multiple days a week for commercial and fashion shoots.</p><p>The house, which is called the "Sheats-Goldstein Residence" was designed by noted architect John Lautner. As we stated earlier, Jimmy grew up around <a href=#>Frank Lloyd Wright</a> homes in Wisconsin, particularly Racine. Lautner was one of Lloyd Wright's <span class="kqEaA z8gr9e">protégés</span>.</p><p>The Sheats Goldstein Residence was designed between 1961 and 1963, and construction began in 1963.&nbsp; The residence was built for Helen and Paul Sheats and their five children. The design is one of the most well-known and celebrated examples of American Organic Architecture.</p><p>The home was designed from the inside out, and the exterior structure is built directly into the surrounding landscape in such a way that it is an extension of the environment around the home.&nbsp; Rather than leveling the surrounding rocks and vegetation, a practice that is common in most building projects, Lautner absorbed the landscape into the design itself, solving any structural issues through architectural adaptations as he went along.&nbsp; The result is a truly striking and one-of-a-kind home.&nbsp; The house has five bedrooms, four and a half bathrooms, and a living room that opens out onto a large terrace.</p><p>When the home was first constructed, the living room and the outdoor terrace were only separated by forced air. There was no actual wall. The original structure also feature windows that looked directly into the pool behind the house. This allowed Mrs. Sheats to keep an eye on her children in the pool, while she worked in her studio, which was below ground level.</p><p class=p1>The Sheats eventually moved on and two other people subsequently owned the home. By the late 1960s it was empty and decaying.</p><p class=p1>Jimmy Goldstein purchased the home in 1972. He had been living in a high-rise apartment and he wanted to find a more comfortable home for his Afghan hound, Natasha.</p><p class=p1>with the goal of restoring and improving it. He paid <span><strong>$185,000 in 1972</strong></span>. That's the same as around <span><strong>$1.3 million today</strong></span>. If the home was ever offered for sale today, which is no longer possible as we'll explain in a moment, the Sheats-Goldstein residence would easily be worth well over <span><strong>$100 million</strong></span>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-189213 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/house0.jpg alt="DAVID MCNEW/AFP/Getty Images" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-189213 class=wp-caption-text>DAVID MCNEW/AFP/Getty Images</p><p class=p1>To salvage the decaying mansion, after buying the mansion Jimmy re-hired John Lautner to expand on the original design, and over the course of the next 20 years, they did their best to make the house as perfect as they could. Jimmy would later say in an interview:</p><p>"<strong>It was never my goal to bring the house back to where it was originally, because it wasn't perfect originally. My goal was to make it perfect.</strong>"</p><p>Lautner and Goldstein worked on the house over the years, adding the invisible glass walls, retractable skylights, and custom concrete furniture in keeping with the overall modern minimalist style. The architect also added several unique touches, including a reflecting pool walkway and a glass sink with no visible faucet. Goldstein also decided to set off the minimalist concrete building by planning a jungle of tropical plants around the home and property.</p><p class=p1>Renovations continued, despite the fact that Lautner passed away in 1994.</p><p>Over time he also acquired nearby lots to create a four-acre private jungle in the middle of prime Beverly Hills.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-326308 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/1.jpg alt="Sheats Goldstein House" width=900 height=675 sizes="(max-width: 1632px) 100vw, 1632px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-326308 class=wp-caption-text>via Brian Warner</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-326309 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/2-1.jpg alt="Living Room Couches from Sheats Goldstein House" width=900 height=675 sizes="(max-width: 1632px) 100vw, 1632px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-326309 class=wp-caption-text>via Brian Warner</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-326310 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/3.jpg alt width=900 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 1624px) 100vw, 1624px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-326310 class=wp-caption-text>Via Brian Warner</p><p>In addition to the home itself, there is also an art installation that on sits on the hill just below the structure, designed by James Turrell.&nbsp; The installation, called "Above Horizon", was commissioned by Jimmy. It was meant to be a collaboration between Lautner and Turrell, but Lautner passed away before the installation was fully underway.&nbsp; "Above Horizon" features a room with portals and a concrete lounge. Every evening, the room turns into a mind-boggling sky and light show, created by thousands of LED lights.</p><p>The property has an "infinity tennis court" on a connected lot that overlooks the Los Angeles skyline.</p><p></p><p>Directly below the tennis court is an underground fully functioning nightclub called "Club James". The club has hosted many many celebrities. <a href=#>Rihanna held her 27th birthday party there</a>, featuring attendees such as <a href=# title="Mick Jagger Net Worth">Mick Jagger</a>, <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> and many more.</p><p>As we stated previously, if the Sheats Goldstein Residence was ever put on the open market, the <a href=#>property would likely be worth north of $100 million</a>.

In 2016 Jimmy Goldstein announced he had reached a deal to donate his famous house to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art ("LACMA") upon his death.</p><p>In addition to donating the actual residence, Jimmy had to donate an additional $17 million trust fund to cover ongoing maintenance for the property after his death.</p><p>The donation is the first of its kind for LACMA, and includes not only the home and the interior furnishings but several other buildings on the property, as well as Goldstein's private art collection and other items. Although the donation will not fully go into effect until after Goldstein's death, LACMA plans to begin hosting limited tours and other events in the home. LACMA is planning to eventually use the space for fundraisers and exhibits to showcase the home's unique architectural characteristics and educate the public about Los Angeles' rich architectural history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq970aKaoZ2jqXqjtculoKimkZ6%2Fpr%2BOo6CmpalitLC4w6yrnqGeYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
