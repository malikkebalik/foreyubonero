In a Washington Post interview in 1988, eight years before her death, when the interviewer called her very wealthy, Audrey replied:</p><p>"<strong>That's nonsense, that 'very wealthy.' What a pain in the behind that is! They make it sound like you're so rich it's stupid. A lot of people thought Bob owned Continental Airlines. He was merely president and CEO.</strong>"</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Audrey Meadows was born as Audrey Cotter on February 8, 1922 in New York City.
