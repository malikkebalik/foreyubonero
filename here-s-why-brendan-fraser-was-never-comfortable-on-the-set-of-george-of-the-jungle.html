The 1997 <a href=#>movie</a> is one of Fraser’s most beloved films for several reasons. While the actor delivered a great performance as the fish-out-of-water George, he was uncomfortable filming the movie.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-brendan-fraser-played-a-spoof-of-tarzan-in-1997-s-george-of-the-jungle>Brendan Fraser played a spoof of Tarzan in 1997’s ‘George of the Jungle’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=par-2_50><a href=#>George of the Jungle</a> is a comedy film based on an animated TV series of the same name, which borrows from Edgar Rice Burroughs’ creation Tarzan. The movie follows a primitive man (Fraser) raised by apes in the African jungle who falls in love with a San Francisco heiress Ursula.</p><p id=par-3_59>After Ursula and George meet, her treacherous wealthy fiancé Lyle’s minions discover his talking best friend Ape and try to capture it to take it back home and make money off him. A scuffle ensues, resulting in Lyle shooting and injuring George with a tranquilizer. Ursula flies George back home <a href=#>for medical attention</a> and to see the human world.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_70>George becomes fascinated by the human world and <a href=#>even uses his skills</a> to rescue a paraglider stuck on a bridge. However, Ursula’s mother tells George they can never be together, so he leaves for Africa. Ursula follows, arriving just in time to win against Lyle and his minions. Ursula and George get married and have a child whom they display to the other animals in the jungle Lion King style.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-brendan-fraser-s-costume-in-george-of-the-jungle-made-him-uncomfortable>Brendan Fraser’s costume in ‘George of the Jungle’ made him uncomfortable</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_47>Fraser’s character in George of the Jungle spends a huge chunk of the movie naked like the animals around him, which he doesn’t seem to mind, <a href=#>save for a loincloth</a>. Fraser’s toned body in the film is enough to ignore that he swings around with bare-to-no clothing.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_37>However, the <a href=#>Encino Man star</a> said he wasn’t comfortable working under such conditions. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Drew Barrymore</a> on her eponymous show, the Bedazzled actor said he never got used to stripping down daily for work.</p><p id=par-7_46>Fraser recalled coming into work every morning and getting spray painted by a crew member wearing a gas mask, comparing himself to a car in an auto body shop. This isn’t the first time Fraser has talked about his experience on the set of the movie.</p><p id=par-8_39>In another interview, the <a href=#>54-year-old actor</a> recalled feeling dehydrated and starved because of the extent he went to achieve his muscular physique in the movie, recounting an incident where he forgot his ATM pin because his “brain was misfiring.”</p><p id=par-9_41>Fraser also apologized for the stunt on the Golden Gate Bridge in the movie, acknowledging that it caused a huge snarl-up. “I can only apologize for that; my bad, it won’t happen again,” the actor hilariously said after narrating the experience.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>“People are amazing.” The Whale is now showing in cinemas.
