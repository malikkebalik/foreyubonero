Another benefit is being able to sit and relax in the back of your super expensive luxury cars while someone else drives them for you.</p><p>If you like to drive fast cars, The Mercedes-Maybach S600 Pullman might not be the car for you. On the other hand if you like to sit back and be surrounded by luxury (and you have a chauffeur), it might be perfect.</p><p>The Pullman nameplate recently made a comeback but then slowly faded away. It is now back again with the Mercedes-Maybach S600 Pullman, which made its debut at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. The unveiling coincided with the 50th birthday of the best known version of a Pullman sedan, the Mercedes-Benz 600.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-145706 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1-e1430694104819.jpg alt=1 width=670 height=377 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-145706 class=wp-caption-text>Photo Via Norbert Aepli, Switzerland/Wikicommons</p><p>Pullman sedans have been used by many governments, royal families, and celebrities. In fact, legendary musicians like <a href=# title="Elvis Net Worth">Elvis</a> and <a href=# title="John Lennon Net Worth">John Lennon</a> have owned a Pullman and so have celebrities like <a href=# title="Elizabeth Taylor Net Worth">Elizabeth Taylor</a> and <a href=# title="Coco Chanel Net Worth">Coco Chanel</a>. The Mercedes-Maybach S600 Pullman is made by Daimler AG. According to the company, this luxury car is "the embodiment of exclusivity at its highest level." If that doesn't make owners of this car sound stuck up I don't know what does.</p><p>This version of a Pullman is over 21 feet long, which is nearly 4 feet longer than a Mercedes-Benz S-class. Daimler has said that the rear compartment resembles a "club lounge." It has two reclining executive seats that face forward and another two seats that fold down and face rearward. To keep passengers entertained it will feature a Burmester sound system or an upgraded High End 3-D Surround Sound System. It will also feature a standard 18.5 inch monitor which can be electrically extended. The rich and famous in the back of this car have the ability to control the glass partition that separates them from the driver. They can lower it or change it from transparent to opaque for added privacy with one touch of a button.</p><p>This car is mostly about the luxurious interior, but it also has a 6.0 liter twin-turbo V12 engine with 523 horsepower. It will be available for delivery outside of the United States sometime in early 2016. The Mercedes-Maybach S600 Pullman is a special model that will only be made to order. It is expected to cost over $566 thousand, unless you prefer an armored version, which should go for about $1 million! If you ever get the chance to see this car in person you know the paparazzi won't be far behind.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm6vwKuqaKKlobawecaeq2asmJp6tMDRnqucoF2ptaZ5zJ6pnJ2UmsBuucCymZqbmGLAd3yPZqeupJyirq97</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
