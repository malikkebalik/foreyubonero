These photos would have been enough for me to think that Lily might be pregnant, <a href=#>but The Daily Mail also has these photos </a>– Lily over the weekend looking even more bump-y. Of course, The Daily Mail also points out that Lily tweeted her denial about being knocked up, but CB and I think that she probably is, and she’s just not ready to announce it yet. Back in late 2007/early 2008, Lily was pregnant, and she <a href=#>suffered a miscarriage</a>. After that, she spoke about wanting children often, and late last year she announced <a href=#>she was taking one to two years off, perhaps to start a family</a>. I think it’s on.</p><p>She’s been talking about starting a family since the beginning of the year. But Lily Allen has denied she is pregnant after pictures emerged of her sporting a suspicious-looking bump under her dress this weekend. The 25-year-old singer was spotted in Central London with her belly appearing to protrude more than usual.</p><p>However, Lily took to her Twitter account to state quite categorically: ‘I’m not pregnant.’</p><p>The sighting comes just days after her announcement to leave the music scene and focus on starting a family with her boyfriend Sam Cooper.</p><p>She said: ‘I’d like to have a child within a year. It’ll be a minimum of four or five years before I make a record again. I don’t think that mixes well with the idea of settling down and having children, which is ultimately my goal and more of a priority than flying around the world.’</p><p>Allen told Absolute Radio: ‘I’d want to be really hands-on for the first two or three years of having a little one. I don’t want to leave them.’</p><p>And in, January during an appearance at the Big Day Out event in Australia, she told the festival crowd ‘I want to have a baby’.</p><p>After suffering from a miscarriage three years ago with ex boyfriend Ed Simons, Allen has made it well known that settling down and raising a family away from the media spotlight is her goal. Lily has been dating Sam Cooper, 44, since July last year. She is said to have become enamored with the decorator’s down-to-earth manner.</p><p>Last year a source told The Sun newspaper: ‘Lil is tired of only ever being involved with well-known blokes. She wanted to go out with someone her own age who isn’t involved in music or the media. Sam is really down to earth. He grafts hard for a living as a painter and decorator and leads a totally normal life. Lily is completely smitten with him. They have known each other for a while but have only just started dating properly.’</p><p>[From <a href=#>The Daily Mail</a>]</p><p>If she is knocked up, congratulations to her and to her boyfriend. If she’s not, I guess she’s just been enjoying her sabbatical with cheese fries and donuts, and why not? That’s what I would do if I had some time off. Not so much with the cheese fries, but definitely with Chinese food and corn chips. Can you tell that I’m hungry? Mmm… corn chips.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/wenn2842923.jpg alt=wenn2842923 title=wenn2842923 width=580 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Lily Allen in London on May 13, 2010.
