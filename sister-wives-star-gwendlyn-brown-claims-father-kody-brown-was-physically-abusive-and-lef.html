She believes the spankings she had as a child at the hands of her father were abuse. “And I know some of you may disagree that spanking is abuse, and it is. It is an excessive way to discipline your children, and there are better ways to that won’t leave them emotionally scarred,” Gwendlyn said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gwendlyn claims Kody left bruises on her as a child</h2><p id=par-5_45>The Sister Wives star made some shocking allegations.
