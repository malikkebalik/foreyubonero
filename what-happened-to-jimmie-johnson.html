When police arrived, they found Jack, 69, dead from a gunshot wound in the hall of the home, near the door.

Dalton, who was 11 years old when he died, was the nephew of Johnson’s wife, <a href=#>Chandra Janway</a>, whom the race car driver <a href=#>married in 2004</a>. It’s unclear which of Chandra’s three siblings — Jordan, Caleb, or Marianne — was Dalton’s parent.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>Jack and Dalton’s cause of death was declared a homicide.
