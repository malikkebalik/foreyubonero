Linda Gehringer, the actor who portrayed the character, revealed fans recognized her after her episode aired.</p><p>Published on December 10, 2022</p><span></span><span>2 min read</span><p id=par-1_57>Linda Gehringer played an iconic but short-lived role in&nbsp;<a href=#>Gilmore Girls</a>. The stage actor took on the part of Richard Gilmore’s much-discussed ex-fiancee&nbsp;<a href=#>Pennilyn Lott</a>&nbsp;in a single episode of the series. Despite only appearing once, Gehringer’s character was a memorable one. So memorable, in fact, that she revealed a group of acting students were thrilled to meet her.</p><h2>Who was Pennilyn Lott?&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-2_45>Pennilyn Lott appeared in the season 4 episode, “Ted Koppel’s Big Night Out,” but her name was mentioned several times before making an appearance. Pennilyn dated Richard Gilmore before he met&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Emily G</a><a href=#>i</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lmore</a>. The duo was engaged, but presumably, Richard called it off to pursue Emily.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Pennilyn-Lott.jpg><p id=par-3_81>In the episode, Pennilyn, in a conversation with Lorelai Gilmore, made it clear that she knew more about Lorelai’s life than she should have. When Emily confronted Richard about it, he admitted he had been meeting his former love once a year for lunch for the entirety of his marriage. The revelation left Emily reeling, but Pennilyn never appeared again. She was, however, mentioned several episodes later in a telegram that&nbsp;<a href=#>Trix Gilmore</a>&nbsp;sent Richard on the eve of his wedding to Emily.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Linda Gehringer said acting students were excited to meet her after her role in ‘Gilmore Girls’&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-4_115>An actor being recognized for a role in&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;isn’t surprising. The show’s biggest fans know the series inside and out and can name most characters who appeared on the show, even those who appeared only briefly. Still, Linda Gehringer was surprised. Gehringer told Scott Patterson during an appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I Am All In&nbsp;</a>that&nbsp;she was surprised when she was recognized as Pennilyn Lott. She told Patterson that she ran into a group of acting students who were super excited to meet her because of her role on Gilmore Girls. Gehringer stated that fans were excited to meet her. Thankfully, they weren’t judgemental about Pennilyn Lott, despite her status as the woman who came between Emily and Richard.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Max-Greenfield.jpg><p id=par-5_43>Gehringer went on to portray more significant roles since her brief stint on&nbsp;Gilmore Girls. She appeared, most recently, in&nbsp;Physical, but is often recognized for her appearances on&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy&nbsp;and&nbsp;Justified. Before&nbsp;Gilmore Girls, Gehringer was best known for her work on&nbsp;Evening Shade. She played Fontana Beausoleil.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-linda-gehringer-isn-t-the-only-minor-character-actor-who-is-still-associated-with-their-gilmore-girls-role>Linda Gehringer isn’t the only minor character actor who is still associated with their ‘Gilmore Girls’ role&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-6_53>Gehringer isn’t alone in her experience. She is far from the only actor who played a minor role in&nbsp;Gilmore Girls. She also isn’t the only actor to be recognized for a minor part. Max Greenfield, whose parts in&nbsp;<a href=#>Greek&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;New Girl&nbsp;were far more significant than his one-liner in&nbsp;Gilmore Girls, still gets recognized for the role.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=par-7_64>In 2020, Greenfield said that&nbsp;<a href=#>he still gets tweets</a>&nbsp;about playing Dean Forrester’s friend Luke in one&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;episode. In the season 4 episode, Dean, drunk from a parking lot bachelor party, stumbles into Luke’s diner with friends. One of his friends points out that his name is Luke, just like the diner owner. That’s all Greenfield’s character said in the episode. The episode aired in 2004.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0qrjMqKmeZZeev62%2FjKWgp5yRYrSmtNGipaCdomK%2Fpq%2FApaOsZZaaua271maYnKyfp8BursSipaBlla2wqsDEnWSmnZWperGxzaegpbGeYrmwwNNnn62lnGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
