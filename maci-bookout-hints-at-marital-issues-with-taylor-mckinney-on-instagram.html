However, they still have issues in their marriage. Maci opened up about how her relationship with her ex has negatively affected her and Taylor.

I feel like some of ya’ll need to see this.”</p><p id=par-6_20>Some fans on Reddit believe Maci is talking about her husband, but others think she could be referencing Ryan.</p><p id=par-7_30>“Could this be directed at Ryan?” a fan on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> wrote. “Maci always seems very apathetic toward Taylor, so I can’t imagine her feeling as if he’s ‘broken’ her ….”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-couple-had-disagreements-over-ryan-edwards>The couple had disagreements over Ryan Edwards</h2><p id=par-8_33>Teen Mom OG couple Maci Bookout and Taylor McKinney have their fair share of issues seen on the show.

But then, [Taylor] is my husband, and he has raised Bentley with me, so there’s just a lot of temperature checking that goes on.”</p><p id=par-10_39>Maci and Taylor also addressed their marital struggles with Dr. Drew Pinsky during a reunion show in 2021. Taylor noted that he and Maci fought over “ridiculous stuff.” The couple agreed they had trouble communicating and prioritizing each other.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-teen-mom-family-reunion-season-3-trailer-shows-maci-bookout-breaking-down-over-her-marriage>The ‘Teen Mom: Family Reunion’ Season 3 trailer shows Maci Bookout breaking down over her marriage</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_39>Teen Mom: Family Reunion Season 3 will likely give fans an in-depth look into what Maci Bookout’s relationship with Taylor McKinney is like now.
