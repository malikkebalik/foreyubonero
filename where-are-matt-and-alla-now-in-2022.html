When filming for 90 Day Diaries, Alla was still pregnant with <a href=#>their son, Marcus Alexander</a>, who was born on the same day as their 13-year-old son Max. Check the photo of Alla and Marcus on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> below:</p><p id=par-3_49>As fans recall, in season 4, Alla moved her life from Kyiv, Ukraine, with her son, Max, from her previous marriage. The happy couple got married and got busy growing their family. They also have their daughter, Emmalyn Grace, who just celebrated her second birthday in April 2022.</p><h2 id=h-alla-and-matt-buy-an-airplane>Alla and Matt buy an airplane</h2><p id=par-4_67>On 90 Day Diaries, a 6-month pregnant Alla updates fans on her life in the United States with Matt, which began when they <a href=#>married five years ago</a>. She tells the cameras, “I wanted to leave Ukraine because I always had a feeling that I will have more opportunities in this country, in [the] US. And I had this thought, what if I be [sic] a pilot?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Alla-and-Matt-Ryan-90-Day-Diaries-Season-3-TLC.jpeg><p id=par-5_42>Alla’s passion to become a pilot spurred Matt to do the same. Together, the two of them bought an airplane they visited at the hanger during the episode. She tells Matt, “I was feeling so energized after each lesson. Full of adrenaline.”</p><p id=par-6_28>Alla had to stop her pilot’s license lessons because of her growing belly, but she’s excited to get back to it after giving birth to their son.</p><h2 id=h-alla-wants-to-hire-a-live-in-nanny-or-au-pair>Alla wants to hire a live-in nanny or ‘au pair’</h2><p id=par-7_44>With their son on the way, Alla is concerned that she might need more help around the house while Matt is away at work. She proposed the idea of getting a live-in nanny or “au pair” to help her with childcare to Matt.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_39>She says, “At this point, with two kids, I definitely need help.” She tells Matt, “I had this thought, it would be nice to have somebody to, you know, living with us and just help all of the time.”</p><p id=par-9_62>However, Matt isn’t sold on the idea. He says, “To me, it doesn’t make any sense. Why does she need somebody to be at the house to take care of the kids when that’s what she does?” But after talking to his brother about Alla’s request, he agreed to start looking for an au pair to help Alla around the house.</p><p id=par-10_32>It’s fantastic to see one such 90 Day Fiancé couple doing so well five years after getting married. Matt and Alla continue to be one of the franchise’s most <a href=#>successful love stories.</a></p><p id=par-11_13>New episodes of 90 Day Diaries Season 3 air Mondays on discovery+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSGcXnDmrBmnJmWv6qx0masqZyRqbJuw8eeqZ5lnZbBtXnApaOaZZ6kxG5%2Bj2tpZ6Ckorlw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
