But, just because many of the show’s stars already have a high net worth, it doesn’t mean Bravo isn’t paying them big bucks to drink and fight with each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/southern-charm-cast.jpg><p id=par-2_27>What are Kathryn Dennis, Shep Rose, Craig Conover, Cameran Eubanks, Austen Kroll, Naomi Olindo, Chelsea Meisner, and <a href=#>Eliza Limehouse</a> earning this season? Keep reading to find out.</p><h2>Everyone receives the same amount</h2><p id=par-3_49>Unlike the ladies in the Real Housewives franchise, everyone on Southern Charm gets the same paycheck. According to <a href=#>Radar Online</a>, each main cast member earns $25,000 per episode. And, with 15 episodes each season, that comes to $375,000 for about three to four months of filming each year.</p><p id=par-4_32>The recurring members of the cast obviously take home less. And, when Ashley Jacobs was on the show during Season 5, she didn’t earn a penny. But, that changed when she returned for the reunion.</p><p id=par-5_19>“Ashley was lowballed. They offered her next to nothing to film the reunion, but she wanted to go,” claimed an insider.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-6_44>There is no doubt that $375,000 is a huge payday for letting cameras follow you around for a few weeks while you go on vacations, attend dinner parties, drink a lot of alcohol, and fight with your friends. But, it’s nothing compared to some of the Housewives.</p><p id=par-7_19>Real Housewives of Atlanta star NeNe Leakes earns nearly $2 million per season, making her the highest-paid Housewife in the franchise.</p><h2>They get a bonus for the reunion</h2><p id=par-8_34>To make sure that everyone attends the reunion taping, Bravo pays the Southern Charm cast members $60,000 each to show up and confront each other about all of the drama that went down during the previous season.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-3 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/Randy_Haas/status/1022610270210932738</p></figure><p id=par-9_43>That is a sweet paycheck for one day of filming, but there are times when cast members don’t show up. Former star Thomas Ravenel skipped the Season 5 reunion, which they taped just a few weeks after two women came forward and accused him of sexual assault.</p><h2>Rumors of a raise</h2><p id=par-10_39>Before the cast began filming Season 6 last fall, rumors swirled that two cast members got a raise. Cameran Eubanks and Shep Rose allegedly got massive salary increases because they were fan favorites, and they were also the ones who brought the drama.</p><p id=par-11_35>“For the new season, both Cameran and Shep got a big bump in their salary,” claimed an insider. “Cameran and Shep make the show what it is and they’re the most popular, so Bravo gave them a raise.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-12_29>The source added that the rest of the cast was mad about Shep and Cameran getting more money, but since they are all independent contractors, they can each negotiate their own salary.</p><p id=par-13_23>“There could be a revolt on Southern Charm,” the insider explained. “The lower paid cast members are pretty mad about Cameran and Shep’s raises.”</p><h2>The wealthiest ‘Southern Charm’ star</h2><p id=par-14_43>While everyone in the cast earns a nice paycheck, there are definitely some stars who have more money than others. Patricia Altschul – the show’s matriarch – is currently worth $20 million, and her son – executive producer Whitney Sudler-Smith – is worth $2 million.</p><p id=par-15_22>Shep Rose is the wealthiest member of the main cast, as he is worth $4 million, and Cameran Eubanks is worth $1.5 million.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-5></figure><p id=par-16_35>Former star Thomas Ravenel – who was a main cast member for the first five seasons – has a net worth of $6 million, but he and Bravo parted ways last September after his arrest for assault charges.</p><p id=par-17_8>Southern Charm airs Wednesday nights on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAsMHToZyrpl2YtaK%2BzGauoaGTnXquscybnKtln5t6tbTEZpqaq6RitKbA0manmqGUYsGpsYympqysXp3BrriO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
