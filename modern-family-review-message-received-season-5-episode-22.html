Both shows are terrific in different ways, but Louie kicked off its fourth season with such hilarity, such unpredictable fury, such experimental savviness, that any other television comedy airing in its shadow probably feels staler than it should be. Louis C.K. grounds his comedy in bittersweet truth, filling his shows with edge and sensitivity, fantasy and harsh reality. There is no show currently doing more to revolutionize the genre of sitcom television than Louie, while few programs are doing less to break from the mould than Modern Family.</p><p data-characters=532 data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true>Now, that is not to completely put down Modern Family. ABC’s comedy has had several terrific episodes this season, notably “Three Dinners,” “The Old Man & The Tree” and “Las Vegas.” However, the show has piled up two clumsily written episodes in a row, while Louie burst back onto the airwaves with two superb half-hours. Modern Family is going to have to work really hard to appeal to Emmy voters and convince them that a season filled with average, laugh-light half-hours deserves to make television history.</p><p data-characters=825 data-current-count=825 data-injectable=true>Average would also be a perfect word to describe “Message Received,” an episode that squanders its interesting plots with contrived story beats. To nobody’s surprise, Cam has overspent on his wedding to Mitchell, saved for May sweeps but perhaps too drawn out to generate the same excitement around other sitcom weddings (here’s looking at you, Friends and The Big Bang Theory). Both husbands have a plan to get some quick cash – you know, the money that a middle-school teacher and lawyer do not have in savings somewhere. Mitch wants to sell a limited edition Spider-Man comic – his explanation about how he relates to Peter Parker is sweet, but maybe a bit too obvious – while Cam feels that his belt buckle, once worn by Wyatt Earp, could ensure they can deal with their ballooned budget on, ahem, balloons.</p><p data-characters=800 data-current-count=800 data-injectable=false>In the Dunphy household, Haley finds a box with many of Claire and Phil’s mementos. (I guess items of sentimental value are just prominent in this episode). While listening to Phil’s answering machine, the kids overhear Claire’s messages that explains to Phil that she accidentally got pregnant – and he’s the father. With this ‘mistake’ now horrifically out in the open, the kids decide to prank their parents with some manipulated phone messages of their own. I mean, if you were found out you were conceived in the ride back from a Duran Duran concert, you would want to serve a cold dish to your parents. (The best material this week comes from the young actors, from Lily’s Ring Pop manipulation to some funny banter between the Dunphy kids, which this season has really lacked.)</p>Pages: <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>1</span> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>2</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yuu8Oeqadllpa6qrjYZqmerpmaxG65xKyqmp%2BVYr%2Bmr8SirZ6cXaiyor%2FOp2RuZZWltrS7w55ka2pf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
