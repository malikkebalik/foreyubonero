Amell has played the tough and fearsome character since 2012. This year,&nbsp;fans of&nbsp;Arrow&nbsp;were heartbroken to learn that this will be the last season that the iconic show&nbsp;will be on the air.</p><p id=par-2_70>While many fans are sad that they will no longer be able to see Amell play the role of Oliver Queen and the Green Arrow, with the amount of talent that Amell posseses, this will definitely not be the end of the road in terms of his career. Here is a look at Stephen Amell’s impressive career so far, what the future holds for him, and his current net worth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Stephen Amell’s acting career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Stephen-Amell.jpg><p id=par-3_87>Amell was born and raised in Canada. As a kid, he had always known that he wanted to be an actor when he grew up. After graduating St. Andrew’s College in Ontario, he started to seriously pursue acting. The first acting job that he had landed was on&nbsp;Queer As Folk&nbsp;in 2004. He played a spinning instructor on the show and was only featured on two episodes, but the small role helped him get his foot in the door and opened up many more job opportunities for him.</p><p id=par-4_89>After that, he landed other small roles in several different television shows, including&nbsp;Beautiful People, Dante’s Cove,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Heartland.&nbsp;He also starred in a couple of made-for-TV movies. One of the movies was called&nbsp;Justice for Natalee Holloway&nbsp;and was based on the true story of an American teenager who went on vacation in Aruba and was never seen again. In the movie, Amell convincingly played the role of Jordan Van der Sloot, the man suspect of Holloway’s disappearance. Many fans think that this is the role that made Amell’s career soar to new heights.</p><p id=par-5_44>In 2012, he was offered the role of the Green Arrow/Oliver Queen in CW’s newest superhero series,&nbsp;Arrow.&nbsp;Because of his role as the Green Arrow, he has also been featured in other DC television series like&nbsp;The Flash, DC’s Legends of Tomorrow,&nbsp;Supergirl,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Batwoman by way of crossovers.</p><p id=par-6_44>In addition to TV shows and movies, Amell has also been featured on the big screen several times. He has appeared in several short films, and in 2016, he played the role of Casey Jones in&nbsp;The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He’s a real-life tough guy</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_37>On&nbsp;Arrow,&nbsp;many fans were quick to notice Stephen Amell’s impressive physique. He didn’t just get those muscles for the show. Fitness has always been important to him, and in 2017, he actually competed on the show&nbsp;American Ninja Warrior.</p><p id=par-8_45>Amell has also been an avid wrestling fan, and he made a guest appearance on WWE’s&nbsp;Raw. He even fought in a match in the 2015&nbsp;SummerSlam.&nbsp;He was also featured in the Ring of Honor where he competed in a tag-team match at Survival of the Fittest.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Stephen Amell’s net worth?</h2><p id=par-9_62>Arrow&nbsp;is set to air its last episode at the end of the month. However, Stephen Amell’s carer is far from over. According to&nbsp;<a href=#>CinemaBlend,</a>&nbsp;Amell is about to get to combine his two favorite passions: acting and wrestling. He will soon start filming a new series on Starz called&nbsp;Heels.&nbsp;The show is reportedly about two brothers who are in charge of a wrestling promotion.</p><p id=par-10_50>Amell is set to play the more ruthless wrestler (or the heel) on the show. So far, the show has been signed for eight episodes. There is no word yet on when the show will air, but many fans speculate that the show’s premiere will be sometime later this year.</p><p id=par-11_34>Throughout Amell’s career, he has accumulated a net worth of around&nbsp;<a href=#>$7 million</a>.&nbsp;However, with all of the projects that he has lined up for the future, we expect that number to rise in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZqCsZZGnv7DDjKyrmqpdqMGmvMeepWaZnZq5rb%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jaGrpqRf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
