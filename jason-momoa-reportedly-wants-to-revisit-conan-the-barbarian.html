Don’t get us wrong; the actor was a recognizable presence on our screens that had lent his talents to a number of solid projects, but headlining <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the highest-grossing DC Comics adaptation ever made </a>will do wonders for your standing in Hollywood.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>Up until the 2018 one-two punch of his solo debut as Arthur Curry and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the criminally underrated Braven</a>, Momoa hadn’t really been given a strong enough showcase to prove his action hero credentials. In fact, the first time he ever headlined a feature film, the results were positively dire.</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true>Remaking <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Conan the Barbarian </a></strong>wasn’t the worst idea on paper, even if everybody immediately associates Arnold Schwarzenegger with the character, but Marcus Nispel’s 2011 effort was awful. As well as being panned by critics, the sword-swinging actioner flopped hard at the box office after earning just $63 million a $90 million budget.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/conan-640x360.jpg><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>However, we’re hearing from our sources – <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the same ones who told us Ben Affleck was returning for The Flash long before it was confirmed </a>– that Momoa reportedly wants to revisit Conan the Barbarian. While that’s about the extent of the information on offer, it does beg one serious question: Why?</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>The remake both sucked and bombed, Momoa is a big star and Netflix now have the rights to the property, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with a <strong>Conan the Barbarian </strong>show in development</a>.
