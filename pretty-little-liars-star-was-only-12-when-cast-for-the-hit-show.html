From faked deaths to trying to figure out who the mysterious ‘A’ was, the show never failed to <a href=#>leave viewers with more questions than answers</a>.</p><p id=par-2_16>As it turns out, the actors on <a href=#>Pretty Little Liars</a> had some secrets of their own.</p><p id=par-3_31>Sasha Pieterse, the actress who played Alison DiLaurentis, had a secret that shocked everyone who learned of it. <a href=#>Screen Rant</a> has all the juicy details about Pieterese’s secret and much more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is ‘Pretty Little Liars’ about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-4_35><a href=#>According to IMDB</a>, Pretty Little Liars was a show on Freeform. It ran from 2010-2017 and had so many twists and turns, it was almost impossible to keep up with if you missed an episode.</p><p id=par-5_49>If the show had one underlying theme, it was not to reveal your secrets. That’s how the show’s villain A was able to create such havoc. A threatens<a href=#> the four main characters</a> Aria Montgomery, Hanna Marin, Emily Fields, and Spencer Hastings by vowing to reveal their deepest, darkest secrets.</p><p id=par-6_60>Pieterse’s character played a huge role in this, as she was the master manipulator. She would convince her friends to share their secrets and then use it against them. When the Liars begin to get messages from A, they immediately assume it was Alison. It was just another red herring, however. The ultimate mean girl was actually the original victim.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alison DiLaurentis, the girl who wouldn’t die</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-7_35>For much of the show, Alison DiLaurentis was just a memory for the Liars and not a very pleasant one. She alienated her friends, was cruel to other students and made more than one enemy.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_32>Her most famous enemy was the mysterious A, who began to send Alison threats. It was serious enough that Alison began to fear for her life, and even faked her own death.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_50>In one of the many red herrings on the show, a body was discovered that was identified as Alison. It was actually a young woman named Bethany Young, however. In season 5, it was revealed that Alison was really alive, and had fled to Beacon Heights for her own safety.</p><p id=par-10_47>When she returned to Rosewood, she was met with an icy reception. No one had forgotten her past actions, and she even finds herself framed as being the new A. <a href=#>Things do turn out well for Alison</a>, however, as she gives birth to twins, and marries Emily.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Sasha Pieterse’s secret?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Sasha-Pieterse.jpg><p id=par-11_32>Many viewers who watched the show assumed that Pieterse is a teenager. Perhaps 15 or 16. As it turns out, <a href=#>she was only 12 years old</a> during the Pretty Little Liars’ pilot.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_47>Her character was known for her sharp tongue, and the cruel way she had of alienating anyone who she disliked. The fact that this character was played so artfully by a girl of 12 years of age is shocking. It’s also a testimony of Pieterse’s acting skills.</p><p id=par-13_85>Pieterse was no stranger to the screen, however. <a href=#>According to TV Guide</a>, she began modeling at the age of four. That meant by the time she auditioned for a role on Pretty Little Liars, she already had 8 years of experience. More shocking than this, however, is the fact that Pieterse originally auditioned to play Hannah. Given how upbeat and sweet Hannah is, it makes one wonder how the show would have turned out differently if Pieterse had been given that role instead of Allison.</p><p id=par-14_24>Since Pretty Little Liars has ended, Pieterse has been busy. She married Hudson Sheaffer and has announced that she is <a href=#>expecting her first child</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_48>Pieterse has also decided to return as Alison DiLaurentis. She’s resuming the sole that made her so famous on the spin-off show Pretty Little Liars: Perfectionists. For fans who were disappointed that Pretty Little Liars ended, this is both a sequel and a fresh start with new characters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9s7HTrbBmpJmpwa2xjKWgmqqjYsC1rdFmrpqrXaS7rcWMamlmr5iau26vwKyrZp6fp3q1tMRmn6KsXai1sMONoaumpF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
