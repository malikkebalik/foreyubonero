Was it successful? Occasionally.</p><p data-characters=594 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>At its best, the show was able to balance the two styles, resulting in some truly incredible hours (my favorite is likely still “Guest”), but it wasn’t always an easy watch. I’m still bitter about “Gladys,” a punishing episode (I can never unsee that brutal death by stoning, but no satisfying reason has been given as to why such a shocking scene was important) with few redeeming qualities that likely cemented&nbsp;The Leftovers‘ reputation as the best feel-bad show on TV. And many of the season’s mysteries proved more frustrating than exciting.</p><p data-characters=750 data-current-count=750 data-injectable=true>Here we are, though, with “The Prodigal Son Returns,” a season finale with which&nbsp;I’m surprisingly satisfied. No, it doesn’t resolve all (or really any) of the big mysteries at the heart of this show. The National Geographic, whether Dean (totally AWOL here) is real, the dogs, Kevin’s sanity, the truth about Holy Wayne, the cause of the Sudden Departure – predictably, none of it gets explained. Lindelof and Perrotta even throw in one more mystery – Patti, dead by her own hand at the end of “Cairo,” is now apparently haunting Kevin’s dreams. Don’t expect answers anytime soon. Interestingly, though, at the end of this finale, all of those enigmas have never felt less important.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=false>What “The Prodigal Son Returns” mostly manages to communicate&nbsp;is that&nbsp;The Leftovers is not about solving its&nbsp;essential mysteries. At its core, this is a show about grief, depression and how people keep on keeping on, even in times when the very fundamentals of living have been called into question. Mapleton, and what the Sudden Departure did to its citizens, is the real beating heart of&nbsp;The Leftovers.</p>Pages: <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>1</span> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>2</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>3</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmo56epKTDpr7SZqqemaOku26yyKeYpZ1dp7K3tcSwZK2glWK9s7vDop6apF2ovK950Z6rrqqeqHq0scCspqdlYWKysbXSqJueZWFlfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
