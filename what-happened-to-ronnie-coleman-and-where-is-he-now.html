In 2001, Coleman became the first lifter to win a Mr. Olympia title and the Arnold Classic in the same year.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>It was in 1996, however, when Coleman suffered an injury that — because, in part, he neglected to seek help for it at the time — contributed to Coleman’s decision to retire from the sport.</p><h2 id=h-why-did-coleman-retire data-injectable=false>Why did Coleman retire?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>via Don’t Be Sour podcast/YouTube</figure><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=718 data-injectable=true>In 1996, Ronnie Coleman dislocated a disc in his back <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">doing squats</a>. By 2007, the pain caught up with him, and he retired to get a series of surgeries to help address the problem, among other physical issues such as herniated discs in his spine, worsened by competitive powerlifting, bodybuilding, and training. Those included two disc replacement surgeries and, in 2019, a surgery to repair broken screws in his back.</p><p data-characters=69 data-current-count=69 data-injectable=false>In 2022, Coleman told the Don’t Be Sour podcast (via <a href=#>Fitness Volt</a>):</p><p>“When I herniated that disc in 1996 when I was getting ready for the Arnold Classic. Yeah, I was okay, I still did the Arnold Classic and still continued lifting heavy and working out every single day. I think just over time, you know, it wore itself out”</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>Before long, all those medical interventions and other issues became too much. Today, Coleman is unable to walk without assistance and is otherwise confined to a wheelchair. But as Coleman is quick to point out, not all of Coleman’s health problems were caused by competitive weightlifting.</p><p data-characters=91 data-current-count=91 data-injectable=false>Coleman told the Don’t Be Sour podcast that his hip issues, for example, are genetic:</p><p>“I’ve had both hips replaced. My whole family has had both hips replaced. My brother, my uncles, so I guess that’s a genetic thing.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Coleman still trains</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>via Arnold Schwarzenegger/YouTube</figure><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>Despite those health problems, powerlifting legend Ronnie Coleman, who was 59 as of 2023, still trains as best he can but avoids heavy lifting. Otherwise, he manages his <a href=#>Ronnie Coleman Signature Series</a> supplements and apparel brand.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=false>In Aug. 2023, Coleman reemerged alongside another titan of the sport, <a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, for a workout suited to both men’s ages at a Gold’s Gym in Venice Beach. At that time, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Coleman said</a> he still works out six days a week.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpbyzwNJorqGZpGK1orzPnqWenF2pvG6%2Bzqelop1dmLytscyapWaZnpl6uLTEq5xmoaNitaZ5zaiuaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
