Fans have already seen Ugly Sweater’s debut, and many viewers suspect they know exactly who’s singing under the mask. So, who is Ugly Sweater? Here’s the most popular guess.</p><p id=par-2_12><strong>[Spoiler alert: The Masked Singer Season 11 spoilers ahead regarding Ugly Sweater.]</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-ugly-sweater-in-the-masked-singer-season-11>Who is Ugly Sweater in ‘The Masked Singer’ Season 11?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_56>“Transformers Night” on The Masked Singer Season 11 brings the Group A masks and the Group A wild card to the stage. Goldfish, <a href=#>Starfish</a>, <a href=#>Lovebird</a>, Ugly Sweater, and <a href=#>Koala will compete</a> in the hopes of moving forward in the competition. “Transformers Night” features a double elimination, so only three masks will continue to the next round.</p><p id=par-4_92>Viewers saw Ugly Sweater’s clue package at the beginning of the competition. “When I hit the scene as a young, handsome Ugly Sweater, I was the epitome of style on top of the world,” he says while walking outside. However, he says he “unraveled” and lost focus. “I went from living in penthouses to sleeping on park benches. My life was hanging on by a thread. But when I hit rock bottom, I realized I had to change.” Ugly Sweater says he turned his life around and is now “better than before.”</p><p id=par-5_32>So, who sings under the Ugly Sweater mask? Fans feel sure it’s Charlie Wilson, the former lead vocalist of the Gap Band. After the Gap Bands’ retirement, Wilson continued his solo career.</p><p id=par-6_36>“I grew up listening to his music, and that voice is absolutely unmistakable,” a fan on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> wrote. “Ugly Sweater is, without a doubt, the lead singer of the Gap Band. Charlie Wilson!!!! An absolute legend.”</p><p id=par-7_23>‘Without a doubt,” another fan wrote. “[I] know the voice, and his drug problems left him homeless for awhile before coming back stronger.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robin-thicke-guessed-charlie-wilson-in-a-previous-episode>Robin Thicke guessed Charlie Wilson in a previous episode</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/The-Masked-Singer-Season-11-Ugly-Sweater.jpg><p id=par-8_36>Robin Thicke is thinking like The Masked Singer Season 11 fans. After Ugly Sweater sang “The Best” by Tina Turner, the masked singer presented an orange sweater to the judges with the word “featuring” across it.</p><p id=par-9_19>“Ugly Sweater’s always in style,” the singer said. “Must be why the biggest stars want to work with me.”</p><p id=par-10_76>Thicke then made his guesses. “When we’re talking soulful vocal legends, there are only a few people that I think this could be,” he said. “The blue vinyl makes me think of R&B — someone like Aaron Neville, Ronald Isley, Eddie Levert. And I’m not sure, because I didn’t quite hear it in the the voice this time, and I know this guy’s voice so well. But could this be from The Gap Band, Charlie Wilson?”</p><p id=par-11_19>“Love Charlie Wilson!” Rita Ora added. She guessed Verdine White from Earth, Wind & Fire sang as Ugly Sweater.</p><p id=par-12_15>Ken Jeong had a different guess. He believed that Ugly Sweater was producer Nile Rodgers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-these-singers-were-already-unmasked-in-the-masked-singer-season-11>These singers were already unmasked in ‘The Masked Singer’ Season 11</h2><p id=par-13_10>The Masked Singer Season 11 has already unmasked several superstars.</p><p id=par-14_44>In episode 5,&nbsp;<a href=#>Sisqó was revealed as Lizard</a>.
