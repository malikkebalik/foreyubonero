She candidly admitted to “completely unprofessional” behavior on the film’s set. But she also confessed she eventually walked off and left the opportunity behind altogether.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AmandaBynes.jpg><h2>‘Hall Pass’ was the kind of movie Amanda Bynes was hoping for</h2><p id=par-2_39>When Bynes attempted to break away from the mold created by her days as a Nickelodeon icon and teen idol, she supposedly looked for roles closer to what fellow former child star <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> was getting around 2010.</p><p id=par-3_44>According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood Reporter,</a> Bynes hoped for a part like Hall Pass. It was a mature comedy with stars like Jason Sudeikis, Owen Wilson, and Christina Applegate in the leading roles. The raunchy movie took on the idea of marital “hall passes.”</p><p id=par-4_40>Bynes was to play a babysitter with a lusty interest in Wilson’s character. But The White Lotus star Alexandra Daddario eventually replaced her. Stories from insiders suggested Bynes didn’t remember her lines or get along with other cast members.</p><p id=par-5_34>But Bynes eventually spoke about her time on the set herself. And she fessed up to some erratic and unideal behavior, sharing it came due to drug use and a <a href=#>negative self-image.</a></p><h2 id=h-amanda-bynes-left-hall-pass-by-rushing-off-set>Amanda Bynes left ‘Hall Pass’ by ‘rushing off set’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Amanda Bynes Grabs Hall Pass – Owen Wilson, Jason Sudeikis and Jenna Fischer star in the Farr… http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEMdnUPNmXXKRN</p>— Movieweb (@movieweb) <a href=#>February 17, 2010</a></figure><p id=par-6_35>Bynes told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paper</a> magazine she remembered “literally tripping out” when she first saw herself in scenes from Hall Pass.

She said it was “the mixture of being so high that [she] couldn’t remember [her] lines and not liking [her] appearance” that prompted her to leave the film in the manner she did.</p><p id=par-8_55>Despite reports claiming filmmakers fired Bynes, she said she left. “I made a bunch of mistakes but I wasn’t fired,” she explained. “I did leave… it was definitely completely unprofessional of me to walk off and leave them stranded when they’d spent so much money on a set and crew and camera equipment and everything.”</p><h2>Amanda Bynes was in a conservatorship for more than 8 years</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Actor Amanda Bynes has been released from a court conservatorship that put her life and financial decisions in her parents’ control for nearly nine years.</p><p>A Ventura County judge said Bynes has demonstrated she is competent to handle her own affairs. <a href=#>https://t.co/lNffmX3tpu</a></p>— The Associated Press (@AP) <a href=#>March 22, 2022</a></figure><p id=par-9_21>In 2013, Bynes’ mother won temporary conservatorship over the star.
